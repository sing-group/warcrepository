<p><b>Embarrassing a Reporter Can Backfire</b>
<br><i>By Joan Stewart</i></p>
<p>Experienced Publicity Hounds know that when a reporter asks you a question you'd rather not answer, one of the worst things you can do is to say "no comment."

<p>It labels you as:
<ul type="circle">
<li>Guilty, even when you're not</li>
<li>Wimpy and cowardly</li>
<li>Unable and unwilling to defend yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>So what's worse than "no comment"? Trying to embarrass the reporter by asking an unrelated question so preposterous that it's designed to throw him off guard. People who do that usually end up embarrassing themselves.

<p>Sharon Dotson of Bayou City Public Relations in Dallas, Texas sent a link to a video interview conducted by investigative reporter Elliott Davis of WTVI Channel 2 in St. Louis, Missouri back in 2002. Elliott hosts a segment called "You Paid for It" in which he uncovers government waste and corruption.

<p>In this particular interview, he was asking St. Charles County Executive Joe Ortwerth about the battle between Ortwerth and county judges over the new $5.3 million county justice center that had been standing vacant for several months. The judges wanted metal detectors and a full security detail in the building. Ortwerth refused. Taxpayers were left paying for utilities and other expenses while the disagreement wound its way through the courts.

<p>When the reporter asked Ortwerth about the squabble, Ortwerth first said he would answer questions but only if the reporter submitted them in writing.

<p>When Elliott Davis persisted with his questions, Ortwerth asked: "Do you know that Jesus loves you, Elliott?"

<p>"Yes, and I love Jesus," Davis replied. Then he kept questioning Ortwerth. The county executive continued digging a deeper hole for himself with responses and questions related to Jesus.

<p>Instead of trying to embarrass the reporter, the politician ended up embarrassing himself. Not only did his responses make him look guilty, wimpy, cowardly and unable and unwilling to come to his own defense, they made him look clueless. The reporter, on the other hand, appeared cool, calm, collected -- and completely in charge of the interview. That, in turn, gave the investigation more credence.

<p>Judge for yourself by <a href="http://www.parmet.net/pr/2007/10/11/either-the-worst-example-of-media-relations/" target="_blank">seeing the entire interview here.</a>

<p><b>Bernstein Crisis Management Turns 14</b>
<p>Just a note of gratitude to the clients, contractors, vendors and, of course, ezine readers who have made it possible for Bernstein Crisis Management to celebrate its 14th year in business this month. Special thanks to my loved ones for sticking with me even when, at times, there was a fine line between self-employment and unemployment, and to Mssrs. Wilson and Smith for teaching me to put first things first.

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Richard Levick returns to the pages of "Crisis Manager" with insight that the Red Cross, despite some obvious challenges in the area of leadership selection, demonstrated great skill in communicating about the dismissal of its latest president. </i>
<p><b>Ripping Off the Band-Aid:</b>
<br><b>From The People Who Run To Disasters, Not Away From Them</b><br><i>By Richard S. Levick</i></p>
<p>When I first heard about the <a href="http://mparent7777-2.blogspot.com/2007/11/american-red-cross-forces-president.html" target="_blank">Red Cross' dismissal of its president Mark Everson</a>, I thought, ÔHere we go again.' <a href="http://jobsanger.blogspot.com/2007/11/more-troubles-for-red-cross.html" target="_blank">Five presidents in six years</a> isn't a good track record for any organization and doesn't inspire confidence, internally or externally.

<p>Upon further reflection, however, I've come to more fully appreciate the courage and leadership of the Red Cross - an organization that's been heavily criticized over the past few years (think <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/rc_blinks.html" target="_blank">9-11</a> and <a href="http://philanthropy.com/news/philanthropytoday/2832/red-crosss-katrina-aid-draws-criticism" target="_blank">Hurricane Katrina</a>).Yet despite this litany of highly public criticism combined with their revolving door presidency, the Red Cross Board decided to run to the crisis. How bold of them to rip off the proverbial Band-Aid and suffer the shorter-term sting rather than to set their organization up for longer-lasting suffering.

<p>The Red Cross' board made several good strategic decisions:

<ol>
<p><li>They got it over with:  Board members understood that by asking for Mark Everson's resignation, they were creating a two-day news story: Day one to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/11/27/red-cross-ousts-its-president-chief-lawyer-steps-in/" target="_blank">announce that he had been dismissed</a>, and day two for the media and public to analyze it. After the initial 48 hours, there won't be too many more stories on the matter.  Take a look at the charts below to see what I mean.

<p><li> They're setting a higher standard: By dismissing Everson in a time when they certainly didn't need any more bad publicity, they're sending a message internally and externally: ÔWe have a higher standard at the Red Cross.' It is what you would expect from the people who run to disasters, not away from them.

<p><li> They understood that Everson wasn't entrenched: The fact that the Everson scandal broke within the first six months of his tenure was, in an ironic way, a lucky break for the board. As far as the public is concerned, Everson doesn't bleed Red Cross red in a way that someone like <a href="http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&id=49" target="_blank">Elizabeth Dole</a> did. They knew that they could distance the organization from him more easily.

<p><li> They chose to be the saint, not the sinner: Had the Red Cross known about the allegations and chosen to do nothing, they would have been setting up a ticking time bomb situation. What would have happened if the wife had found out or the girlfriend went public, and the public learned that the Red Cross had known about it and done nothing? Because they decided to face the issue head-on, they got to choose the timing, <a href="http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_7312,00.html" target="_blank">and the messaging.</a>
</ol>

<p>Organizations and companies - even those whose reputations aren't as in flux as the Red Cross' - can learn a thing or two from how one of the world's most recognizable charities (and brands) handled this crisis. It doesn't feel like it today, but bravo, Red Cross.

Rene has graciously given me permission to provide this exclusive excerpt from his latest tome to </i>Crisis Manager<i> readers.</i>
<p><b>How to Prevent Situations From Becoming Crises</b><br><i>By Rene A. Henry</i></p>
<p>There are 10 steps a company, organization or institution needs to take or have in place to hopefully prevent a crisis, quickly close the crisis, or to meet the crisis as a challenge and create a positive opportunity.
<p><b>1. Anticipate and Have A Plan</b>

<p>This will be discussed in more detail in the Chapter 2. Anticipate every possible crisis and "what if ..." every possible incident and scenario. Organize a crisis management and communications team, and then create a detailed plan to communicate and be in a position to control the message to the media and all publics.

<p><b>2. Respond Immediately</b>

<p>When a crisis strikes, respond immediately. Have the spokesperson prepared and ready to go. Follow the steps outlined in the crisis communications plan and put the team into action. The first few hours are most important in establishing credibility and building public trust and believability. Do not stonewall. Be responsive to the media and inform the people who need to be kept informed, especially employees, shareholders, vendors and customers. 

<p>Eliminate "no comment" from your vocabulary. One way or the other, the media will get information, but it may be inaccurate and the sources unreliable. In a crisis, perception is stronger than reality and emotion stronger than fact. When those responsible do not communicate, the crisis still gets played out in the media and possibly even later in court.

<p>The communications plan should "what if ..." all potential situations, and in many cases a news release can already be prepared for media distribution. For example, if a crisis team believes the company may be a target for a labor strike, a news release can be prepared, approved by all concerned and put on the shelf for future use. One former client faced a situation where the two top officers traveled frequently, and might not be reachable for a quick response to the media. Having a pre-approved news release would allow the company to quickly respond until the top executive could be reached. 

<p>If there is potential of litigation, either as a plaintiff or defendant, have detailed fact sheets and background materials prepared and ready to release to the media when needed. 

<p>Use the company's website as one of the important information vehicles and have someone assigned to keep it constantly updated.

<p><b>3. Do Not Overtalk</b>

<p>Just the opposite of stonewalling, do not overtalk or release information without having all of the facts. Never speculate on what may or may not be happening. Be sure to analyze each situation for its newsworthiness. Some information may not warrant media attention. Former White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "You don't have to explain what you don't say."

<p>You don't have to answer every question. Just because a question is asked doesn't mean you have to answer, but you should have some kind of response. In any crisis, there are questions that you simply cannot or should not answer. Hypothetical questions, proprietary questions and speculative questions should be politely turned away. The spokesperson needs to be trained and reminded that he cannot be expected to know the answer to every question asked. But never withhold information that should be disclosed.

<p><b>4. Always Tell the Truth</b>

<p>Never lie or deceive the media or public with misinformation. Sir Winston Churchill once said: "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on." It is all right to say "I don't know" if you don't have the facts. The media and public will respect you for that, and know that you are telling the truth. Never speculate. Colin Powell said it is best to get facts out as soon as possible, even when new facts contradict the old. "Untidy truth is better than smooth lies that unravel in the end anyway," he wrote in his book, "My American Journey."

<p>According to a survey conducted by the Porter/Novelli public relations firm, 95 percent of people are more offended about a company lying about the crisis than the crisis itself. Even worse, 57 percent polled believe that companies either withhold negative information or lie.

<p>However, if you are in a crisis in a political campaign in the State of Washington, the state's Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, declared that lying is not unconstitutional, or, put another way, it's just fine.

<p><b>5. Accept Responsibility</b>

<p>If there is a problem, admit it. Be accountable and accept responsibility. There is an old Belizean Creole proverb, <i>bad ting neba gat owner</i>, which literally means bad things never have owners. Everybody disclaims responsibility when things go wrong.

<p>Today almost no one wants to be responsible or held accountable for their actions. Fingers are always pointed at someone else. Real life situations all too often mirror a cartoon by Bill Kean, creator of the comic strip <i>The Family Circus.</i> In one cartoon, all of the balloons have the children saying "not me" in response to a "who is responsible?" question.

<p>Today's leaders in government and business and even the media have fueled a rising tide of public distrust and skepticism. The sooner a company accepts responsibility for its actions, the stronger is its credibility with the general public and the media. In any crisis situation, the faster a company, organization, institution or individual tells a public it is responsible and accountable, the faster it will be able to manage communications and have its message believed or even better, closure on the incident and crisis.

<p>Stanley O'Neal, CEO of Merrill Lynch, had the conviction to say he made a mistake because of the firm's involvement in the subprime mortgage game. "Some errors of judgment were made," O'Neal said as Merrill Lynch posted its first quarterly loss in six years and wrote down $7.9 billion on subprime securities, resulting in a $2.3 billion net loss and a reduced credit rating for the company. He accepted responsibility and admitted it, but also lost his job.

<p>In October 2004, Citigroup had banking problems in Japan because of ethical violations and lax controls that may have led to money laundering. Charles Prince, chairman and CEO, flew to Tokyo and with Douglas Peterson, CEO of Citibank Japan, confronted what happened by publicly apologizing and making amends, Japanese-style. A photograph of the two men bowing deeply, bent forward from the waist and heads lowered, was transmitted around the world. Prince then fired three top executive responsible for the violations. Just three years later, Prince resigned as head of Citigroup in the wake of a $6.5 billion third quarter write-down and an estimated additional $8 to $11 billion in losses because of sharp declines in the value of subprime-related securities. 

<p>In research done by <i>IR Magazine</i>, some 5,000 Wall Street security analysts surveyed rated Citigroup as the worst communicator and JPMorgan Chase as the best during the subprime mortgage crisis. Analysts said Citigroup was the least effective in disclosing its exposure. "There was a feeling that they didn't know the full extent or were attempting to soft-pedal it," said Neil Stewart, the magazine's executive editor.

<p>Ronald J. Alsop, staff reporter for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, believes doing the right thing, no matter how painful, is especially important in a crisis. In his book, <i>The 18 Immutable Laws of Corporate Reputation</i>, he cites how Johnson & Johnson did the right and trustworthy thing in 1982 in responding to Tylenol poisoning with its product recall. He compares this with how Roman Catholic bishops covered up incidents of sexual abuse by priests and put the church's reputation above the interests of its parishioners. "Cover-ups almost never work. Why?  Because today almost anyone can disseminate information quickly and widely on the Internet, where it can be seen by millions of people," writes Alsop. "In addition, the Internet is a key source of story ideas for many mainstream news reporters and editors."

<p>A company's liability issues may need to be resolved with the attorneys involved but winning in the court of public opinion, in the long run, is far more important that winning a decision in court. Never go into a denial mode. The media and the public will believe a spokesperson who accepts responsibility, and this is one way to build public trust.

<p><b>6. Select the Right Spokesperson</b>

<p>Determine in advance who will speak for the company in the event of a crisis. More than likely there will be several individuals who are the only ones authorized to speak for the organization during a crisis. Have one individual designated as the primary spokesperson and another as the backup. Additionally the company should have individuals who can serve as technical experts or advisors, such as a financial expert, engineer, or someone who can speak about a highly technical subject. 

<p>Too often the wrong person speaks publicly, and others, because of an "ego syndrome" just want to get in front of a camera. The names of those who are authorized to speak needs to be communicated to all so they understand that requests for comment by the media or anyone else must be directed to an authorized spokesperson.

<p>Always remember that the media will seek out anyone for a soundbite, so there must be a policy in the crisis plan and everyone made aware of it regarding the official voice of the company or institution.

<p>It is important that the person be believable. This doesn't mean being slick or polished. He must be someone the public will trust to tell the truth. All spokespersons must be professionally trained and completely prepared for the media. If time permits, there should be a rehearsal before any media interviews to review all anticipated questions.

<p>"The CEO should be one of the spokespersons, but not necessarily the primary spokesperson," says Jonathan Bernstein, of Bernstein Crisis Management, a national consultancy on crisis management headquartered in Southern California. "The fact is that some chief executives are brilliant business people, but not very effective in-person communicators."

<p>Public opinion has shown that lawyers are not the most trusted of spokespersons and especially outside consulting attorneys. It is best to get the CEO or one of the most senior executives in front of the media as soon as possible.

<p><b>7. Stop Rumors and Correct Misinformation</b>

<p>A no-response is almost the same as implied consent. When something incorrect is printed or said, immediate action should be taken to point out the error and ask for a correction. Otherwise, the media involved will only assume that what was written or said is correct. One publication could print a damaging story with incorrect information. Another publication could assume the information was correct and refer to it in a followup article. When repeated over and over, fiction and errors become fact. 

<p>In a matter of seconds, the Internet can spread misinformation or rumors around the world. This is why it is so important to have open lines of communication with all employees, customers, vendors, shareholders and friends. You want to control your message as best as you possibly can but you can't control what others say. The media will seek out anyone with any connection to the company or organization for information and a quote. Be sure that all authorized spokespersons have correct and current information.

<p>Just as there are clipping services that read newspapers and magazines for any mention of a company or organization, and services that monitor radio and television programs, there are monitoring services that can be retained that regularly check the Internet for information. Adversaries, disgruntled employees and former employees, and whistleblowers can leak confidential information, misinformation or outright lies that are republished on Internet websites, message boards or blogs, and eventually find their way into mainstream media.

<p>Ronald J. Alsop believes companies must protect their corporate reputation by refuting any harmful rumor that is picking up momentum on the Internet. "Ignoring the spread of a detrimental rumor is dangerous in the extreme," he writes. "The correct strategic response is to neutralize the attack with a factual response." He cites Coca-Cola as one company which is a frequent target of many rumors, and which publishes denials and refutations on its own website, while others, including Nike, develop a separate websites devoted exclusively to refuting rumors.

<p>The electronic age has created entirely new problems for crisis managers and attorneys. "Thanks to modern technology, all a person needs to extract and use misinformation from a false, archived article is a PC, Google, and a disposition to work someone else's old material into an article on the theory that if Big Media reported it five years ago without repercussions, it must be true," says John J. Walsh, senior counsel of Carter Ledyard and Milburn, New York. In most jurisdictions, after one year, statutes of limitation expire on libel and defamation claims against a publication.

<p>Walsh notes that a media crisis based on an article or broadcast can occur without warning, and often can be precipitated by a whistleblower and a quick decision by the media to go public. He says the injured party can ask for a correction, a retraction or an apology. A correction by the publisher tells the public that a mistake was made and provides the correct facts. A retraction advises the public that specific statements are withdrawn, usually accompanied by an apology or at least a statement of regret.

<p>I consider Walsh one of the finest First Amendment attorneys in the country today, and if a company, organization, institution or individual is facing a crisis, I would want him involved at the first hint of a negative media story. Working in concert with public relations counsel, I would have him visibly lead the response effort directed at media editors and senior management. A call or letter from Walsh often can get a proposed story dropped or substantially and favorably altered. 

<p>Sometimes the information you release could be wrong, and this must be corrected. During the Persian Gulf Desert Storm operation, Colin Powell had an argument with General Norman Schwarzkopf regarding television comments that four Scud missile sites had been taken out when, in fact, air reconnaissance photos showed that the targets were fuel trucks. A CNN camera crew shot film of the destroyed trucks and contradicted Schwarzkopf. Powell told his general to admit the error. "Protect your credibility, it's a precious asset," said Powell. "It is better to admit a mistake than be caught in one."

<p><b>8. Show Compassion and Remorse</b>

<p>It is not against the law to show compassion, sympathy, passion and remorse for victims and their families and friends. This often is when the public relations counsel and lawyers disagree. The public relations professional wants to win in the court of public opinion, and the lawyers are concerned about potential liability and losing in a court of law.

<p>"Expressing sorrow or concern publicly in the wake of a tragic event is understandable. It is also critical," says Jeff Braun, founder and president of Crucial Communications Group, LLC, a Houston, Texas-based firm specializing in crisis and emergency response communications training and support. "Empathy or caring is a key component of credibility. And establishing credibility must be the overriding goal of any communication. If your audience does not see you as a credible source, you won't get your message across or be able to address people's concerns. Empathy and caring accounts for half of a person's credibility and is assessed in the first 30 seconds. You have to convince the listener that you are credible, believable, trustworthy, and even likeable."

<p>Compare what Braun recommends with how San Diego State University responded when a student opened fire in a classroom and shot and killed three faculty members who didn't agree with his thesis. When the university refused to comment, the media interviewed a maintenance worker and two people who had been in the classroom when the shooting began. The university missed an opportunity not only to tell its story, but to express remorse and show compassion for the loss of three members of its family as well as their families and friends.

<p><b>9. Build Your Reputation Before A Crisis</b>

<p>Never take any chance of losing your credibility with the media and public.  That is why it is so very important to establish your reputation before a crisis and have credibility in the bank. Build relationships with the media so they know you are telling the truth in the face of challenges from adversaries. 

<p>According to Harris Interactive, a company's reputation is often overlooked as a component of business growth. In today's market, consumer trust is at an all-time low. Following the series of high-profile scandals that have irreversibly changed the corporate landscape, Hill & Knowlton believes the need to establish trust and confidence is more recognized than ever.

<p>The degree to which a company will get the public to believe its story will depend on the company's reputation before a crisis. Magazines will publish lists of "most admired companies" or "best companies to work for." But this doesn't always translate into winning public trust if the public relations department and the people who are in contact with the media have not established their reputation and credibility with the media. 

<p>But Americans today also are less trusting of the news media. Of 1,100 individuals surveyed, 42 percent responded that the media are not credible in general, and that television news, newspapers and magazines all were less credible than five years earlier. Only eight percent considered the government, and two percent considered political parties, to be believable sources of information.

<p>Scores of books have been written and are available on the subject of corporate reputation.

<p><b>10. Listen</b>

<p>During a crisis, it is important to listen to what the public and adversaries are saying and to be sure that they, and the media, understand what you are saying. Listening is essential to communicating, negotiating, resolving conflicts and even avoiding crises. You have to be an active listener to anticipate the actions of others. However, listening is hard work. For some people, it is very difficult, but it can be learned. Listening is truly an admirable and enviable art for those who listen well. 

<p>From our earliest development years, we all are taught how to speak, read and write. No one is there to teach us how to listen. Stephen R. Covey ranks listening as one of his <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>. "Seek first to understand, then to be understood," he says. "Most people don't listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They're either speaking or preparing to speak."

<p>"The ability to listen to others is essential," says Harvard University's Dr. Lawrence Susskind, conflict resolution guru and author of <i>Dealing With an Angry Public.</i> "When high-ranking spokespersons or executives are being assaulted by those who are fearful, anxious, and angry, they must put aside their own feelings and defensiveness so they can listen carefully to what people have to say.

<p>"Good leaders, effective in times of crisis, must be as keyed into their audience's interests as their own," Susskind adds. "You will not be able to acknowledge the concerns of others if you cannot hear them. Listening must be active. This means reiterating what has been heard to be sure the message has been received."

<p>In any conflict or negotiation, you must be an active listener. Focus on the speaker and your adversaries, take notes, ask questions, and make eye contact so they know you are listening. Communication must be two ways. Communicate your expectations clearly, accurately, timely and honestly. According to Covey, words represent only 10 percent of communication. The sounds we make and our inflection represents 30 percent, and our body language another 60 percent. 

<p>Remember that the less you say, the more someone else will be able to remember what you say. It is just as important for someone listening to you to fully understand your message as it is for you to understand what they are saying. Saul Alinsky, who wrote the bible on nonviolent disruption, <i>Rules for Radicals</i>, says it best: "If you try to get your ideas across to others without paying attention to what they have to say, you can forget about the whole thing."

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Readers have responded with GREAT enthusiasm to articles related to online crisis management, so I'm going to  continue to focus on this area as long as I have new material, such as the following two outstanding articles by guest authors!</i>
<p><b>Reputation Management: How to Survive an Online Attack</b><br><i>By Penny C. Sansevieri</i></p>
<p>If you've never been the center of an online attack you're lucky, if you have, you know what I'm talking about. The Internet has brought with it a lot of good things, but it's also brought a sea of citizen journalists who have access to some of the most powerful tools we've ever seen. If you weren't following the Amazon debacle on Twitter this weekend (search #amazonfail to get up to speed) then you missed quite a drama. Prior to that (a week or so ago) a publicist sent a letter to a blogger that had much of Twitter up in arms as well, our COO Paula Krapf blogged on this story, you can <a href="http://amarketingexpert.com/ameblog/?p=783" target="_blank">read about it here</a>. The publicist who at one time was fairly under the radar, became center stage for a heated debate and, likely, ruined her career and integrity for a long time to come. </p>
<p>But it's more than just preparing for an attack that many of us will never experience, it's about reputation management which is key in an age of instant everything. </p>
<p>As ethical and careful as we all are, it can happen to anyone. It's one of those things that doesn't happen all the time (thank God) but when it does, you want to be ready,  just like that earthquake preparedness kit that's collecting dust in your closet. It's there when you need it and much like understanding how to manage your reputation online, you want to know what to do when the Internet strikes. So what do you do if it does? Well, you don't do what Amazon did and hide under a rock, or this pr gal from Quirk who failed to offer a genuine apology.  You get out there and start your own campaign to fix this. Here's how you do it: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Realize you have no control over what happens: if you try and control all of the bad online press, it'll feel like trying to plug a damn leak with a piece of gum. Accept that something that ignites a flurry of tweets or blogs will get out of control very quickly. Take a deep breath and deal with it - beginning with where the noise is; for instance, if the crisis is limited to Twitter, then your strategy should focus on interaction with the Twitterers involved. There's no point in doing something on your blog or website if it's a specific social media site that's up in arms - if you respond to them directly, in their medium of choice, you're on the way to solving the problem. The longer you just worry about the flurry, the longer it'll take you to figure out a strategy. </li>
  <p><li> Accuracy be damned: with everyone being a reporter, remember that sources and the like don't matter - at least not initially - in the Twitterverse. During the Amazon mess there were rumors that it was a hacker (promoted by a hacker), a disgruntled employee, the stories ran the gamut. </li>
  <p><li> Monitor the Internet: always, always, always know what's going on out there. It could be something as simple as one blogger posting information on you that isn't 100% accurate, they like accuracy as much as we do so in a friendly way, set the record straight. That's what Google alerts are for - set them to your name, your business, book - whatever brand or brands you have that should be monitored.</li>
  <p><li> Be quick to fix this: don't wait and watch as your message spirals out of control, jump on this quickly and correct it before it turns into a wildfire of tweets and blog comments. In this era of social media, your silence will be filled by others all too eager to step in and offer their own answers, even if their information is incorrect. Then you've got a bigger problem - the conventional wisdom is completely wrong and now there's even an Internet footprint that makes the misinformation seem like it's real.</li>
  <p><li> Be sincere: we all screw up, be sincere and genuine. I think if Amazon had come out early on and been more transparent about their process, this wouldn't have caught fire the way it did. You don't want a bunch of people you don't know out there being your spokesperson. If you're not speaking up, someone else will do it for you (and review #4).</li>
  <p><li> Words are key, so is honesty: if someone is attacking you and you are really at the center of this mess, remember that now is not the time to try and come up with some politically correct answer. Be clear in your message and do whatever you have to do to fix this. </li>
  <p><li> Relationships: more than ever, relationships are key. Building relationships within your area of expertise will greatly help you manage your reputation and an attack, should there one happen. Get to know the people who specialize in your industry and let them know who you are by networking with them and being helpful. Having relationships in place is crucial to any campaign but when it comes to reputation management, it's much easier to go back to the friends you already have than try and build these relationships when there's trouble.</li>
</ol>
<p>With all the ways to get media these days, you want to know what people are saying about you. Keeping track of the conversation will not only help you ward off an attack if one should ensue, but it will help you get to know the people who are important to your message. Keeping track of who's posting on you, reviewing your book, and featuring your articles will give you the chance to network and, as I pointed out in point #7, give you the opportunity to go back to an existing relationship and fix a problem if there's trouble. And that's being a savvy Internet marketer.</p>

<p><b>Inside a breaking online crisis:</b>
<br><b>How to monitor internet rumours about a large organisation and provide actionable data and strategy to senior management</b><br><i>By Will Critchlow</i></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we were approached by a large public company which was in the middle of a breaking crisis. We knew their external PR and crisis teams who were trying to work out how to deal with a new kind of breaking issue. Unlike many reputational crises, this was not only being reported online, it was actually happening online.</p>
<p>A loose network of individuals in other countries were forwarding false accusations about the company in question. These accusations were spreading like wildfire via blogs, on twitter, on other social media sites, via official company pages (e.g. on Facebook) and on hard-to-find foreign-language forums. The accusations were built on a repetition of old rumours but with a nasty new twist. Not only were there calls to boycott the company's products and services, but there were also nasty undercurrents of potential violence against employees and property.</p>
<p>The biggest immediate challenges were to get on top of what was being said. The board wanted to know what was being said. The corporate communications guys wanted to know what was being said. But they couldn't read it all - there was a large volume of discussion and they had important decisions to make.</p>
<p>Our perfect crisis response strategy involves planning for the crisis in advance. The problem with Ôadvance' is that it's hard to do it when you are fighting the fire! So the first action in this scenario was to start gathering information and turn it into executive summaries (in the true sense of a summary that helps executives make decisions).</p>
<p>It felt very important to start thinking about response strategies and plan for future likely outcomes. It was critical, however, that the first step once the monitoring was running was to determine escalation actions. As an external agency who had been brought in as the crisis broke, we didn't already have the contact details of decision-makers in the company. Since there was a likelihood of serious threats being discovered during the monitoring process, we needed to make sure that we knew what to do if we discovered a credible threat. With the help of the client team, we determined a simple escalation process with a hierarchy of action based on threat ranges that went from &quot;include in the next daily summary&quot; through &quot;email alert to designated contact&quot; to &quot;telephone calls to a set of security people&quot;.</p>
<p>So, our actions so far were to get monitoring rolling as quickly as possible and then immediately determine escalations of urgent / serious threats. From this point, we started working on the data elements that were needed to make decisions (volume of conversation, tone, new themes) before getting into the strategic stuff.</p>
<p>The two critical strategic elements were to determine response strategies and forecasts.</p>
<p>Response strategies have been widely written about and traditional crisis communications theory talks a lot about the possible repercussions of different actions. Decisions about if, how, when and where to respond can be the subject of another case study - I'll keep the focus on the internet questions.</p>
<p>We wanted to be able to provide management-friendly forecasts of what tomorrow's summary was going to look like. In order to do this, we considered a range of inputs - including volume trends, emergence of new themes, news coverage, brand evangelists defending the brand for them etc. Although we couldn't predict volumes with high levels of accuracy, neither was exact accuracy the critical factor. We were seeking planning for resource deployment and senior decision maker time at the appropriate levels. We were actually surprised at how effective this process was for that. While there are people with large amounts of experience in the offline news cycle, the spread of viral information is less widely understood and we found that the single most beneficial piece of data for senior management was the forecast of future trends.</p>
<p>In summary, while basic monitoring was critical (especially to pick up the threats) and response strategy was a big win of the project (but out of scope of this case study), the shape of the reporting was interesting. Our reports' structure was:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Executive Summary</li>
  <li>Immediate Forecast</li>
  <li>Wider Trends</li>
  <li>Serious Issues Already Raised</li>
  <li>New Themes</li>
  <li>Important Changes to Existing Discussions (e.g. Facebook, Wikipedia Talk etc.)</li>
  <li>Samples of Other Discussion</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="ped"></a>PLAIN ENGLISH DISCLOSURE</h2>
<p>Bernstein Crisis Management, Inc. has formal or informal co-promotional and mutually beneficial business associations with a number of the services we mention periodically in this newsletter.

That said, you should also know that Bernstein Crisis Management sought the relationships because its staff is convinced that these services are the best of their kind for Bernstein Crisis Management's needs and those of its clients. If you have any questions about these relationships, please contact Jonathan Bernstein, (626) 825-3838.

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Ford
introduced the Explorer<span>&nbsp;</span>in 1990, replacing the Bronco II. The larger and more stylish
Explorer<span>&nbsp;</span>was an immediate hit and quickly became the
most popular SUV<span>&nbsp;</span>sold by any automaker. As [plaintiff attorney
Tab] Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>had begun to specialize in lucrative SUV<span>&nbsp;</span>rollover<span>&nbsp;</span>cases, he began looking for victims in
Explorer<span>&nbsp;</span>accidents. He would argue in legal briefs that
the Explorer<span>&nbsp;</span>was simply a modified Bronco II<span>&nbsp;</span>allowing him to recycle theories that had
worked so well in his Bronco II<span>&nbsp;</span>cases.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">Turner</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">, along with other plaintiff
lawyers and their legal</span>
assistants, also began combing over hundreds of thousands of notes and records
created during the development of the Explorer. They studiously mined this new document
trail in search of a "smoking gun." They hoped to demonstrate to a jury the
callous way, the lawyers surmised, that Ford engineers had hastily developed
the Explorer, rushing it to market, knowing full
well that safety compromises had been made in the name of quick profit. This
conspiracy<span>&nbsp;</span>theory was not plausible to those inside the
auto industry for three reasons. One, it just was not possible to "rush a
vehicle to market" and have that vehicle become a runaway hit, the No. 1 seller
among SUVs of any size and from any automaker every year for the next 15 years.
Two, in an era when information moves so quickly and completely, it was
patently stupid to knowingly sacrifice real-world safety for some small cost
reduction. And three, it ignored the fact that the Explorer's overall real-world safety record
(in terms of fatalities per 100 million miles driven) was better than most of
the other SUVs in its class and significantly better than the "average"
passenger vehicle of any kind.</p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But
courtroom justice bears little resemblance to the empirical exercises familiar
to engineers where the correct answer demonstrably prevails. The members of a
jury make decisions based on their eval-uation of the facts presented by both
sides, for sure, but they also are swayed by emotion and intangibles, by what
they feel in their hearts. At the center of every serious-injury or fatal auto
accident is human tragedy, and often the victims are sympathetic characters.
The jury feels sorry for the awful event that has come into the plaintiffs'
lives. Then the jury hears the victim's lawyers make accusations about the
large auto company with annual profits in the billions of dollars (not recently,
mind you, but throughout most of the '90s Ford was immensely profitable). How
else is the destitute family coping with tragic loss going to pay the medical
bills? Shouldn't someone - or some company - have to pay for what's happened to
them? The plaintiff attorney's objective becomes to present just enough of a
plausible case to convince a sympathetic jury to award damages <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">against a giant, impersonal company that might
amount to a tiny</span> fraction of its profits that year.</p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Yet,
the real secret behind successful plaintiff attorneys<span>&nbsp;</span>was that they only rarely had to win in the
courtroom. A successful verdict came only after a lengthy and difficult battle
of wits against sharp corporate defense lawyers with vast resources. No, the
secret was to create in the defense team just enough fear and doubt, and just
enough uncertainty about the jury's sympathies that the company would decide to
cut its losses with a settlement offer. Accepting a settlement also took away
the uncertainty from the plaintiff attorneys, who took cases on a speculative
basis, collecting one-third of any verdict or any settlement. The object was to
win just enough high-profile verdicts to show the deep-pocketed corporations
that they could lose if they went to trial, leading to a steady flow of
subsequent settlement checks. (Indeed, in 2007 Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>& Associates claimed on its website to
have reached out-of-court settlements in more than 150 rollover<span>&nbsp;</span>cases involving 16 different types of SUVs
manufactured by eight different auto companies. As of February 2009, the
website no longer featured a running total of tragic SUV<span>&nbsp;</span>cases on its website; perhaps the firm had
decided it was better to emphasize personal service, just as McDon-ald's had
several years earlier when it stopped updating the neon signs <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">outside each restaurant proclaiming the number of
billion of</span> hamburgers served.)</p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And
as Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>came to understand better than perhaps any
other <span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">plaintiff attorney, there were ways to
help turn on the spigot of corporate capitulation resulting in large and
frequent settlements. Ways that involved turning the tide of public opinion
against the </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">company. Tab Turner</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>knew the best way to influence public opinion</span> was through the mass media. And all
it took to generate a juicy, inflammatory story was to leak to an ambitious
journalist some of the same documents he'd been gathering for years as he spun
his conspiracy<span>&nbsp;</span>stories to juries, on those rare occasions
when he actually had to take a case to trial.</p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>became so successful that he had bought his
own personal jet<span>&nbsp;</span>to more easily move around the country paying
visits to grieving families, all the while maintaining a level of comfortable
luxury befitting such a successful lawyer. Of course, the image-conscious
Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>went to great lengths to down-play the money he
was making and the size of his own personal fortune. He did not want anyone to
wonder how an extravagant lifestyle squared with a well-developed reputation<span>&nbsp;</span>as the champion of poor, downtrodden victims
of greedy, <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">rich corporations. When Turner</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>collaborated with writer Adam</span> Penenberg<span>&nbsp;</span>for the rather sappy biography <i>Tragic Indifference</i><i>:
One Man's Battle with the Auto Industry over the Dangers of SUVs</i>, they addressed the issue of Turner's private jet<span>&nbsp;</span>by declaring that it wasn't a "flashy jet," but more like a humble "Plymouth with wings." A
few pages later, Penenberg<span>&nbsp;</span>reveals that the jet<span>&nbsp;</span>was actually a Cessna Citation, a sleek and modern aircraft that
few of Turner's clients would be likely to
confuse with a Plymouth. <br /></p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="text-indent: 0in; text-align: center; font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <br /></p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Like
any good student of public relations, Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>refined his method of placing stories in the
media as he grew more experienced. He and many of the other trial lawyers hired
PR firms to help them place stories in the media, but they did it quietly
because they certainly did not want to be seen as corporate. By the time of the
Firestone tire recall, Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>had developed excellent relationships with
many journalists. A number of reporters from prominent and influential
publications, notably Myron Levin<span>&nbsp;</span>of the <i>Los
Angeles Times</i><span>&nbsp;</span>and Mylo Geylin<span>&nbsp;</span>of the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i><u>,</u> were infamously reliant on plaintiff attorneys<span>&nbsp;</span>to bring them salacious stories of corporate
wrong-doing. (Inexperienced corporate PR people from every industry had made
the mistake of assuming that the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i>'s reporters would operate from a starting point sympathetic
to Big Business. The opposite was often true. Many of the <i>Journal</i>'s reporters had a quite liberal disposition and took it
upon themselves to provide balance against the paper's overtly conservative
editorial page.) Turner<span>&nbsp;</span>had an almost unlimited supply of Ford and Firestone
documents from years of depositions. It didn't matter that neither he nor any
plaintiff attorney had ever prevailed against Ford in an Explorer<span>&nbsp;</span>rollover<span>&nbsp;</span>trial. He was making a fine living on settlement
money. And it didn't matter if these documents had invariably been presented as
evidence in court only to be disputed and often thoroughly discredited by
Ford's lawyers. If no one had written a story yet about the document it
qualified as news, along with the conspiracy<span>&nbsp;</span>theory it "proved." All he had to do was slip
the document to the media hounds and watch them ratchet up the public pressure
against the automaker. <br /></p>

adversaries' tactics.</i></b><i>
Arguing cases in a courtroom is a ruthless game. When trial attorneys bring a
mentality of "win at any cost" to public relations, they aren't going to play
by the rules we're used to. Know the technical side of your story inside and
out. Call out misleading tactics of your adversaries while countering their
accusations with facts.</i><span> <br /></span></p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;[Louisiana Congresman
Billy] Tauzin<span>&nbsp;</span>sent his closest aide and spokesperson, Ken
Johnson, and two other staffers, first to Dearborn<span>&nbsp;</span>and then to Nashville, to probe into some of the most
contentious issues before the hearings. On August 25, Ford's Helen Petrauskas<span>&nbsp;</span>and Tom Baughman<span>&nbsp;</span>welcomed the House Committee team and led them
to a conference room on the second floor of WHQ. Ford lawyers and Government
Affairs people <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">sat in on the all-day meeting,
and I represented Public Affairs. Petrauskas</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>and Baughman</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>answered most of the Congressional staffers'
questions in direct, conversational language. When the</span> Washington<span>&nbsp;</span>guests asked for
documents that had been referenced, the Ford hosts readily produced them. The meeting
appeared to be going <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">well. Conversation was
often light. When it was time for lunch, </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">sandwiches were brought in so work could continue. By mid-</span>afternoon,
the staff investigators seemed pleased with the answers they had received along
with the promises the Ford team had made to forward a number of additional
documents that could not be located readily. </p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">Tauzin</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">'s investigators
would return to Washington</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>for the</span>
weekend, then visit Firestone's Nashville<span>&nbsp;</span>headquarters the following Monday. Johnson<span>&nbsp;</span>remarked that Ford was cooperating much more
readily than Firestone. He left us with the clear impression that Ford's
helpfulness and Firestone's intransigence would be reflected in the tone of
questions the two companies' executives would face in the hearings the
following week. However, Johnson's demeanor would change when he
stepped in front of media hungry for their next story. There was more political
gain to be had for himself and for his boss by attacking both companies.
Johnson<span>&nbsp;</span>and Tauzin<span>&nbsp;</span>would not hesitate to criticize Ford on any
issues where they perceived vulnerability. The <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">fact-finding visits by the investigators were all about finding</span>
weaknesses and contradictions in the two companies' stories. Congress<span>&nbsp;</span>would have plenty of hard questions for both
companies. All we could do was to try to tip the balance of doubt away from
Ford. </p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">A pack of media had gathered outside the Glass House</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">,</span> undoubtedly alerted by Johnson<span>&nbsp;</span>that Congressional investigators were in the
building. As the three staffers walked out of the building to the Lincoln Town
Car limousine we had arranged to take them to the airport, Johnson<span>&nbsp;</span>talked to the journalists, paying particular
attention to the two television<span>&nbsp;</span>cameras. Congress<span>&nbsp;</span>was determined to find out for the sake of the
American public, he told them, why Ford and Firestone had waited so long to do
anything about the deadly accidents. <br /></p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0in; font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;" align="center">*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="BodyTextFirstindentjustified" style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Ford's
Public Affairs team had triple duty in the two weeks leading up to the
hearings. In addition to handling the deluge of media <span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">calls as well as the various pieces of employee and dealer</span>
communications, we now had to help Governmental Affairs and our lawyers prepare
the written testimony and the vast amount of backup [Ford CEO Jac] Nasser, Petrauskas<span>&nbsp;</span>and Baugh­man<span>&nbsp;</span>would need as they were grilled by Congress. The extensive media Q&A<span>&nbsp;</span>that I had continued to add to each day was
used as the starting point for the Q&A in the executive backup books being
prepared for the Congressional hearings. Not every question was used and many
new ones were added. Some answers were too long and some needed further
explanation or added <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">detail. We deferred to
Governmental Affairs in matters directly</span> pertaining to the hearings, of
course. They conducted several extensive training sessions to prepare the
executives for the questioning, similar to the media training that Public
Affairs routinely conducted for <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">company
executives preparing for interviews. But there were</span> fundamental
differences, primarily in tone. In addressing Congress, deference was
essential. An executive was not used to maintaining humility and respect for a
person asking tough, even rude, questions. But a witness at a Congressional
hearing must never forget to maintain composure and mannerly behavior at all
times. The last thing you wanted to do was to get into an argument with a
Congressman in a hearing, an argument you would not win. <br /></p>

So, I posted the following report in the newsletter of the National Information Officers' Association (NIOA) to share with my fellow members. I'm also a member of CESA (California Emergency Services Association). The author of the book, Amanda Ripley, was the keynote speaker at our annual conference this year. She held the audience of emergency responders in rapt attention as she told them how important the proper information is to the public during a crisis. She described how human beings process information and our brains transfer the information into action, or inaction. The take-away message was crystal clear to me. We must consider not only what we say, but what people will hear. And that is affected by their experiences and their state of mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; kt</em><br /><br /><br />I came across two quotes recently that stopped me cold. One was validating and one was stunning.&nbsp; They both pertain to public information and they are both from a new book; <a style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline" track="on" shape="rect" href="http://www.amazon.com/Unthinkable-Survives-When-Disaster-Strikes/dp/0307352900/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1287013689&sr=8-1" linktype="link" target="_blank">The Unthinkable </a>by Amanda Ripley, a senior writer for <em>Time</em> magazine. This book should be required reading for anyone who is involved in emergency response, especially PIOs.<br /><br />The focus of the book is why some people survive a crisis and some don't.&nbsp; The book is rich with information about how the human brain processes messages during a crisis and then directs the body to respond. But it reads more like a well-written case study, actually, dozens of well-written case studies.<br /><br />It takes you inside the stairwells of the World Trade Center, into the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, to fires, floods, and airplane crashes. It isn't grisly or voyeuristic. In many ways, it is uplifting and reassuring about the nature of human beings to survive and help others to survive. <br /><br />Back to those quotes:<br /><br /><strong>Quote # 1</strong> - "I think (Hurricane) Camille killed more people during (Hurricane) Katrina than it did in 1969". <em>Max Mayfield, Director of the National Hurricane Center.</em><br /><br /><strong>Quote #2</strong> - "Since 9/11 the U.S. government has sent over $23 billion to states and cities in the name of homeland security. Almost none of that money has gone toward intelligently enrolling regular people like you and me in the cause. Why don't we tell people what to do when the nation is on Orange Alert instead of telling them to be afraid? Why does every firefighter in Casper, Wyoming (pop. 50,632) have an eighteen-hundred dollar HAZMAT suit--but we don't each have a statistically derived ranking of the hazards we actually face, and a smart, creative plan for dealing with them?" <em>Amanda Ripley.</em><br /><br />You can probably guess it was Quote #1 that was stunning to me.<br /><br />Quote #2 validated what many of us have been thinking and saying for years. As PIOs we have always known that more money needs to be spent on public information. People can die due to a lack of information or the belief in wrong information. <br /><br />That leads me to explain Quote #1: The majority of people who stayed in their homes during Katrina and drowned in their attics had one thing in common, they were old. They had been middle-aged when Hurricane Camille went through New Orleans in 1969. Like Katrina, Camille was a Category 5 storm, and these people had lived through it. Many of them told their families that they didn't want to evacuate. They could live through Katrina just like they lived through Camille. But according to <em>The Unthinkable</em>, since Camille, "rapid development had destroyed much of the wetlands that had provided a natural barrier against storm surge". <br /><br />The reader is left to wonder how many lives might have been saved if those people had that piece of information, and of course, if they believed it. I imagined a team of PIOs creating an aggressive information campaign to drive home that single message to these people. Experienced PIOs know the importance of a simple, powerful message...a message that is crafted specifically for a particular group with deliberate attention to their state of mind during a crisis. I wasn't there so I don't know if there was an effort to do this. But the after-action report seems to indicate that this single issue was a cause of multiple fatalities.<br /><br /><em>The Unthinkable</em> tells the reader what PIOs already know... we must consider how people think during a crisis, and treat them accordingly. We are often told that we should not release this or that information because we don't want people to panic. But, as Ms. Ripley points out, people hardly ever panic, in fact, the first response to fright is usually freezing up, or what she calls the "denial phase".&nbsp; We have a "normalcy bias". Meaning we expect everything to be the way it always is, so that when we hear an alarm or someone yells fire, or the ground begins to shake, we don't run screaming. We stop and consider, and mill around and talk to others, and delay our actions, sometimes for extensive periods of time. This book is filled with case studies such as both World Trade Center bombings and Hurricane Katrina in which people died due to lack of information, or faith in wrong information. <br /><br />As PIOs, we are not just practitioners. I believe we should also be advisers. Please consider reading this book, and passing it on to your emergency response coordinators. I think your communities will be safer for it. <br /><br /><em>Karen Terrill has been a crisis communicator for most of her adult life.

The company came out with a vigorous response over a range of communications channels including web video, prints ads, and others - all very strong in denial of the lawsuit's claims and defense of their product quality. <br /><table class="imgCaptionTable" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN-TOP: 20px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px" width="150" align="right"><tr><td class="imgCaptionImage" width="150" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: right" src="pix/BruceBonafede.jpg" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.62" width="150" vspace="5" border="0" alt="Bruce Bonafede" align="right" height="206" hspace="5" /></td></tr><tr><td class="imgCaptionText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; COLOR: #ff0000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><strong>Bruce Bonafede</strong></p></td></tr></table><br />We'll see whether their response works. If it doesn't, I suspect it won't be the fault of the plan. More likely it will be the fault of the messaging. Here are some general guidelines on crisis messaging brought to mind by the Taco Bell response. <br /><br /><strong>Don't be clever</strong><br /><br />Running print ads with the headline "Thank you for suing us" may have seemed clever to Taco Bell, but crisis response is no place to be clever. It's a place to be honest, concerned, informative, two-way, and prompt. Those are what are called the "five tenets of crisis communications" not because crisis management pro Jonathan Bernstein&nbsp;put them in an article, but because they work. <br /><br />Sure a headline like that cuts through the clutter, but everyone on the planet knows companies don't want to be sued over the quality of their products, so a response like "Thank you for suing us" is so blatantly false it's silly. It suggests the company doesn't take the issue seriously. Similar attempts at cleverness will undermine any valid information you have to offer. <br /><br /><strong>Use facts, not fluff</strong><br /><br />In a crisis you can't get away with BS. For instance, from Taco Bell's response: "Taco Bell prides itself on serving high quality Mexican inspired food with great value. We're happy that the millions of customers we serve every week agree." Thanks for reminding us that your food is cheap and you're successful, but what does that have to do with the issue at hand which is the quality of your beef? Having "millions of customers" doesn't mean you haven't been misleading them. <br /><br /><strong>Put things into context</strong><br /><br />Many journalists avoid context like the plague because it tends to make their news less, well, newsworthy. That's why you should use it in your messaging when you can. If the context you provide is valid, you can change perceptions and maybe even the discussion. Do other "Mexican inspired" restaurants use 100% beef? I don't know. But Taco Bell should, and if the others don't they should have considered broadening the discussion. It's tough to pick on a company for doing what everyone else in their industry does.<br /><br /><strong>Give your messages the smell test</strong><br /><br />If someone claims that your product isn't 100% something, don't come back with, well at least it's 88% of what it's supposed to be. Put yourself in the mind of your audience. When you're developing crisis messages, actually listen to your messages. If you were one of your customers or stakeholders, would your messages work? Would they allay your concerns? If not, you have more thinking to do.<br /><br /><strong>Make your messages simple, really simple</strong><br /><br />Most people experience the news the way they experience speed dating - they don't spend a lot of time on any one story. If you want them to "get" your messages, make them simple. Really simple. And don't come up with a long list of "key" messages. Ideally you really have only one basic message: either you did wrong, and here's how you're going to make sure it doesn't happen again; or you didn't do wrong, and here's why. All other messaging should flow from or support your basic message. It also helps if that basic message is credible and convincing. Taco Bell's wasn't. <br /><br /><em>Bruce Bonafede is president of Bonafede Communications, a PR and crisis communications firm based in Palm Springs, CA.

For example, product recalls are sadly only too common, but for Johnson and Johnson repeated recalls in 2010 eventually involved about 288 million items, including about 136 million bottles of medicine for infants and children. And 2011 started equally badly in <a style="color: rgb(76, 134, 156); text-decoration: underline;" track="on" shape="rect" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/business/16johnson-and-johnson.html?_r=2" linktype="link" target="_blank">mid-January</a> when J & J recalled 47 million units of Sudafed, Sinutab, Benadryl and other drugs, just one day after their company spokesperson said they would "take whatever steps are needed to ensure our products meet quality standards, including further recalls if warranted." &nbsp;</p>

<br>
As we publish this edition of <em>Crisis Manager</em>, Sony, Apple and Facebook are still dominating the business headlines, and not in a positive way. Though the sticky situations these three companies have landed in are unrelated, all are proof that those at the top of the heap are far from invulnerable to crisis.<br>
<br>
In this issue, Strata Communications&#39; Helen Slater shares a case study where the New Zealand government&#39;s failure to learn from disaster led to further loss of life and property. Then, another communications pro, Kristy Croom Tucker, shares her tips on how to bounce back from crises of any size.<br>
<br>

<strong>By Helen Slater</strong><br>
<br>
It seems that despite <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">warnings</span> of the most severe kind, disasters will still take people and organisations by surprise. New Zealand is on the Pacific faultline &ndash; most of the country experiences earthquakes of some degree. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In the early morning of 4 September 2010, the Canterbury region suffered a 7.3 magnitude earthquake. It was unexpected and caused a lot of property damage but importantly no loss of life.<br>
<br>
Buildings were destroyed, particularly in the major city of Christchurch&rsquo;s central business district, businesses ceased trading, roads damaged. A regional state of emergency was imposed.<img align="right" alt="" border="0" height="230" hspace="10" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/8d31712ea3796846144841d35/images/Helen_Slater_0552_2.1.jpg" style="border-bottom: medium none;border-left: medium none;margin: 10px;outline-style: none;outline-color: invert;outline-width: medium;display: block;border-top: medium none;border-right: medium none;border: none;outline: none;" vspace="10" width="170"><br>
<br>
The Christchurch Mayor (a former media personality) was returned to office on the back of his performance during this crisis &ndash; polls until then indicated he would be trounced in the election which was under way at the time.<br>
<br>
Mayor Bob Parker was praised for his calmness under pressure, with strong, consistent <span style="font-size: 12px">messages</span>. But the Earthquake Commission, responsible for assessing the 190,0000 insurance claims, acknowledged it could have done better with its communication.<br>
<br>
&quot;Probably in the first week we might have got up earlier with some of the public communication about &#39;what is our role, what is going to happen&#39; ... but that would probably be a matter of days rather than weeks,&quot; the commission told a Parliamentary hearing.<br>
<br>
In the months that followed, the focus was on rebuilding treasured heritage buildings and getting the city back to normal during the thousands of aftershocks that followed.<br>
<br>
But despite experts&rsquo; warnings, Christchurch was still taken by surprise when the next predicted major earthquake struck on 22 February - 6.3 magnitude. It was lunchtime. Thousands of people were out in the streets, in their high-rise office buildings, and in the remaining brick heritage buildings. Facades crumbled, crushing people, buses and cars.<br>
<br>
The total loss of life is now put at 182. The population is still enduring major aftershocks, traumatising them, creating uncertainty. Upwards of 70,000 people left the city, many for good.<br>
<br>
The quality of communication has been patchy. In those first days, I was in the Civil Defence (NZ equivalent of FEMA) HQ.&nbsp; There were around 600 journalists in the city from around the world. Many became frustrated. Here are some reasons why:<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		Unable to get through on the limited mobile numbers (two) provided</li>
	<li>
		Slow response to queries (sometimes even days)</li>
	<li>
		Lack of communication between the different departments (a large bureaucracy was constructed very quickly) resulting in differing information being released</li>
	<li>
		Not allowing journalists access to any areas within the cordon, resulting in some going through without permission. It took a week to organise supervised tours with the Urban Search and Rescue teams</li>
</ul>
Basic lessons for communications:<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		Brief the communications team frequently every shift so they don&rsquo;t work in a bubble</li>
	<li>
		Match people to roles and have a national database of crisis managers to call on</li>
	<li>
		If basic equipment such as whiteboards is available &ndash; use them to display critical contacts, phone numbers and key messages. Keep them updated</li>
	<li>
		Ensure you monitor all media including social media, keep a rumour log and deal to mis-information quickly</li>
	<li>
		When potential issues are signalled, pass them up the chain quickly and follow up</li>
</ul>
Because the focus was naturally on the CBD because of the fatalities, the extent of damage to the eastern suburbs had not fully penetrated the media or Civil Defence consciousness. By early March, criticism was mounting. One commentator said Christchurch was now three cities: Rescue City &ndash; the cordoned off CBD, television friendly, with few residents affected and full of tales of heroism, loss, sacrifice and leadership.<br>
<br>
Then there was Shower City, where there was water and electricity and people could take hot showers and use toilets &ndash; around 65% of the city.<br>
<br>
The third (still suffering deprivation) is Refugee City, with no services, no electricity (at the time the article was written), no waste systems, broken roads, destroyed homes and covered in liquefaction silt, no toilets and few port-a-loos (these are still big problems for the city).<br>
<br>
The port-a-loo problem was raised early in the piece but not fully addressed until around a week later.<br>
<br>
As commentator Peter Hyde said eloquently:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&hellip; locals have few resources, little information, and no &quot;voice&quot;. It&#39;s remarkably hard to call emergency services when your landline is out and your cellphone battery is dead. Maybe you have just enough charge to call the sole Government helpline - but to stay 20 minutes on hold?&rdquo;&nbsp; and<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The official response in this part of the city sounds reassuring, but is not; relief centres and a field hospital - if you can get to them. The army - two drivebys in the past week.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&hellip; Increased police presence thanks to 300 Australians - we haven&#39;t seen them as much as they are needed. And some worthy and welcome images of food and other supplies being distributed at marae (Maori meeting places) and other central points.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In these powerless suburbs, the official response is far from enough.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Also early in March, the Prime Minister announced up to 10,000 houses would have to be demolished with whole streets and suburbs disappearing. The Mayor called the numbers speculative and downplayed the information. Worried and anxious homeowners were left confused.<br>
<br>
By late March, 139 buildings in the CBD had been demolished. The trouble was many were demolished without their owners&rsquo; knowledge. Contents, often valuable stock such as antiques and works of art, were stripped and not given back to their owners. Building owners were angry at their losses, lack of communication and confused messages.<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		Civil Defence respondedwith the community with briefings around the city from the second week of March. These included general briefings from the city council, police, health, education, welfare, geologists, housing and the fire service.</li>
	<li>
		Temporary housing has been organised, with new housing being built on public land through six consortia, as well as portable housing on private land where it can be built on. These messages have been well communicated through the community briefings and the media.</li>
</ul>
There has been a big reliance on the internet for communication from the start. Twitter and Facebook were the first channels to get information out about the earthquakes. YouTube now hosts hundreds of videos and the <a href="http://bernsteincrisismanagement.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8d31712ea3796846144841d35&id=1c16d47e42&e=fd026c752e" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #4c869c; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">www.canterburyearthquake.org.nz</a> plays a major part in the communications effort.<br>
<br>
This was no help to the residents who didn&rsquo;t have power or telephones and no access to the internet, contributing hugely to their frustration levels and feelings of disempowerment.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest challenges in such a crisis is to ensure that the communication is about people, rather than property. As one newspaper columnist said two days after the 22 February earthquake: &ldquo;There is a drastic need to get someone with real communication skills to close the increasing divide between what is happening and what Civil Defence thinks people should be allowed to know about what is happening.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
That last statement about what Civil Defence thinks people should be allowed to know is the most telling.<br>
<br>
Key to good crisis management is clarity and transparency, overlaid with the ability to hear the messages coming back. It&rsquo;s much more than information &ndash; it&rsquo;s about listening and responding as well as informing, right from the start.<br>

IN FIVE (KIND-OF) EASY STEPS</span><br>
<strong>Public Relations Crisis Management for Crises<br>
Ranging From Charlie Sheen to BP Oil</strong><br>
<strong>By Kristy Croom Tucker, M.S</strong><br>
<br>
A public relations practitioner is only as good as his or her latest crisis. While you might be inclined to believe that high-profile coverage or promotion may define a great strategist, a crisis is something that truly tests your skills as a communicator. Unfortunately, many companies&mdash;big and small&mdash;are unprepared for crisis. Either they believe that it is something that can be handled on a one-on-one basis, they mistakenly think that they are immune to crisis, or they don&rsquo;t understand what a crisis is.<img align="right" alt="" border="0" height="230" hspace="10" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/8d31712ea3796846144841d35/images/Kristy_Croom_Tucker.4.jpg" style="border-bottom: medium none;border-left: medium none;margin: 10px;outline-style: none;outline-color: invert;outline-width: medium;display: block;border-top: medium none;border-right: medium none;border: none;outline: none;" vspace="10" width="164"><br>
<br>
According to Al Tortorella, Managing Director of Crisis Management at Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, corporate crisis is a period of inevitable change plagued with trauma that can negatively impact a company&rsquo;s brand, reputation, and even market share.&nbsp; This definition of corporate crisis can be transferred to any form of public relations crisis, whether it refers to an organization, a celebrity, a politician&mdash;anyone or anything with a brand to maintain.<br>
<br>
From Charlie Sheen&rsquo;s latest meltdown to the BP oil spill of 2010, and the mass recall of Toyotas in 2010, crisis can sometimes be avoided but can always be resolved. However, if you don&rsquo;t take crises seriously, it can destroy a company or brand; see Enron. While these five steps to recovering from a crisis may sound easy, the hardest part is getting buy-in from necessary stakeholders.<br>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px">&nbsp;
	</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Get Your Story Straight</strong><br>
		<br>
		According to Slate.com, one of the biggest mistakes that BP made during the 2010 oil spill was releasing inaccurate and inconsistent information. Initially, BP told reporters that it was leaking 1,000 barrels daily when the number was actually closer to 5,000. The disparity in reports and the inaccuracy of the data made the public believe that either BP was being dishonest or that it really didn&rsquo;t know the magnitude of the crisis. Either way, BP lost credibility and the public&rsquo;s confidence.&nbsp; While the pace of a crisis is typically very fast due to media outlets&rsquo; demand for real-time information, it is important not to comment on a crisis until you are able to deliver an accurate and well-thought-out response. In the meantime, tell your stakeholders that you want to be transparent but need to first verify your information before you share it publicly. You need to act fast though, so be sure to have a streamlined internal communication process in place. Most importantly, don&rsquo;t forget your employees. They are the ambassadors of your brand and they need to be confident in you and in the message before you begin taking it to the public.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Be Genuine and Forthcoming&nbsp; </strong><br>
		<br>
		Whether you are at fault or you are defending yourself during a crisis, it is important that you emotionally connect with your stakeholders. In order to do this, your message must be genuine, empathetic, and should convey a level of transparency that gives your public confidence in you and your brand. Despite the inclinations of your legal counsel , you should never say, &ldquo;no comment.&rdquo; When you use these two words, you give up control of your message and create suspicion amongst your public. Instead, you should deliver a message that states the situation, your perspective, and it should reiterate your brand message.&nbsp; If something is your fault, you should express remorse. If it is not your fault, you must emphatically prove it. Above all, you must show empathy for your stakeholders and for anyone who may have been affected by the crisis in question.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Communicate&hellip;.Constantly</strong><br>
		<br>
		If you undergo a crisis, the key is communication. We have already talked about the importance of transparency, and this is where you can truly execute. Dedicate a page on your website to up-to-the-minute crisis updates. Also, utilize social media communication tools such as Twitter and Facebook. If you have media calling, you need to make yourself available to them. After you have gathered the facts and created your message and position, you should hold a press conference. Also, consider reaching out to your local media (not just the big national outlets) and work with them locally. The national outlets will still get the footage, but you will have created a strong relationship with a local outlet. Remember, the media is not your partner or your enemy. The media is a communication tool in times of crisis, and you should use it as thus.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Watch and Engage, When it is Warranted</strong><br>
		<br>
		Brand monitoring tools, such as Radian6, can help you &ldquo;watch&rdquo; your brand and what people are saying about it online, especially on social media. It is important to have a realistic gauge of what people&rsquo;s perceptions of you are, and one of the best ways to do that is to monitor social media. According to The Atlantic, Southwest Airlines &reg; narrowly avoided a potential crisis by monitoring its social media closely). Film Director Kevin Smith was kicked off a flight for reportedly being overweight, and he took to Twitter to talk about the situation. Southwest resolved the situation quickly and avoided what could have been an ugly incident for the popular airline. The cardinal rule to decide whether or not you should engage with something on social media is to weigh the benefits against the potential risks. If the risks and minimal and there is value in responding, then you should. This is especially true if someone has said something definitively untrue about your brand and you can defend yourself with facts.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Recover, Review, and Refine</strong><br>
		<br>
		Once you have recovered from a crisis, it is important to review what you did and refine your crisis communication plan for the future. Not only will you will learn valuable lessons during a crisis, you can continue to improve upon your plan. Plus, you never quite know when a crisis is truly over. It seemed as though BP was finally on the road to recovery after its oil spill. However, at the end of March 2011, the Guardian reported that BP may face manslaughter charges for 11 workers who were killed during the tragedy.&nbsp; This may be the start of another crisis for BP, and it can apply its learns from the first major crisis to create a strong response plan.</li>

<p><a name="note"></a><b><i>Editor's Note:</i></b> From having the pleasure of speaking and/or exchanging email with a number of readers, I know that many of you 


    have a lot to share relative to crisis management. I would love to feature more guest articles in future issues. This publication is read by a very high-end network, from a business perspective, including 


    journalists, so it's excellent exposure for authors. If you're interested in developing a piece for any section of the newsletter, please write to <a href="mailto:&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109</a> or call me at (626) 825-3838.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="prevention"></a>AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION</h2>


<p><b>How the Media Uses the Internet</b></p>


<p>In the Sixth Annual Middleberg/Ross Print Media in Cyberspace Study <a href="http://www.middleberg.com">(http://www.middleberg.com)</a> is a chart which shows the relative 


    popularity of online information sources to which journalists go when news breaks -- as in crisis situations. It will be very useful to my crisis 


    prevention and reaction planning and, I suspect, to yours. Below, I summarize the chart editorially.</p>


<p>Popularity and weighted ranking of sources for newspaper reporters, from most to least popular:</p>


<ul>


    <p><li>Interested parties/community groups/emergency services (2.7)</li>


    <p><li>Industry experts (2.1)</li>


    <p><li>Company websites (2.0)</li>


    <p><li>&quot;Branded&quot; Online News Services (CNN, MSNBC, etc.) (0.8)</li>


    <p><li>Activists' websites (0.7)</li>


    <p><li>Other online services (e.g., NEXIS) and Trade Assn websites (0.6)</li>


    <p><li>Web-based message boards/chat, including Usenet (0.2)</li>



    <p><li>NO newspaper media would go to AOL message boards/chat groups</li>


</ul>


<p>Popularity and weighted ranking of sources for magazine reporters, from most to least popular:</p>


<ul>


    <p><li>Industry experts (2.5)</li>


    <p><li>Interested parties/community groups/emergency services (2.1)</li>


    <p><li>Company websites (2.0)</li>


    <p><li>Trade Assn Web Sites (0.9)</li>


    <p><li>&quot;Branded&quot; Online News Services (CNN, MSNBC, etc.) (0.8)</li>


    <p><li>Other online services (e.g., NEXIS) (0.7)</li>


    <p><li>Activists' websites (0.5)</li>


    <p><li>Web-based message boards/chat, including Usenet (0.2)</li>


    <p><li>AOL message boards/chat groups (0.1)</li>


</ul>


<p>The difference in the deadline requirements of newspapers versus magazines is apparent in the rankings. Live sources are preferred. But 


    the high ranking of company websites for both categories should be a call to action for any organization which has not yet learned how to 


    create a &quot;virtual newsroom&quot; for use during crisis situations (the topic of a future article).</p>


<p>One of the report's two authors, Professor Steven Ross from the Columbia University School of Journalism, tells CM &quot;the study shows 


    that trade association websites are considered highly credible -- but journalists don't use them, apparently because they don't know about them. This suggests that trade associations (should) try to get members 


    to put a linking icon on members' home pages -- and (it) supports (the idea of) beefed up trade association sites.&quot;</p>


<p>And despite a lot of hearsay about the impact of chat rooms and Usenet groups, you'll note that they are still very low-ranked as 


    information sources -- while Activists' websites, although not highly ranked, are a factor we should all stay aware of and monitor. Of course, some of you may BE the &quot;Activists,&quot; in which case you're 


    probably bucking for a higher ranking!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="manage"></a>!MANAGE THIS!</h2>


<p><b>A Crisis Management Case History:<br>Acquisition -- A Good News Crisis</b></p>


<p>A crisis is not always a &quot;bad news&quot; situation. The definition of crisis which I prefer is &quot;an unstable or crucial time or state of affairs whose 


    outcome will make a decisive difference for better or worse (Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary).&quot;</p>


<p>A very typical crisis with which both bad and good news can be associated is a large business acquisition/merger/takeover. How well 


    it's handled, from a crisis/issues management perspective, can make that &quot;decisive difference for better or worse.&quot;</p>


<p><b><i>[Prologue]</i></b></p>


<p>Midas Bank, a multi-billion dollar, publicly held institution based in the midwest, was amongst several organizations vying to acquire Struggling 


    Savings &amp; Loan, a privately held California-based bank. Although Struggling's balance sheet was a little lopsided, it had an 80-branch operation, all in California, with excellent customer and community 


    relations. Midas, which already had 20 branches in California and hundreds elsewhere,was informed by Struggling's board that they were the first choice to acquire Struggling -- and the powers-that-be had 


    decided the deal would go through in two weeks. Only then were both in-house and external public relations personnel notified of the pending merger. It was agreed that Midas would take the lead in creating and 


    originating day-of-acquisition announcements.</p>


<p>The deal was going to result, operationally, in more resources for Struggling's growth and improvement and improved service to customers, with no immediate branch closures or layoffs, with any 


    duplication of services to be phased out by natural attrition. It would also result in a promising new profit center for Midas.</p>


<p><b><i>[Preparing for Crisis]</i></b></p>


<p>A crisis communications team was rapidly created to prepare for day-of-acquisition announcements and reaction. The team consisted of top management and legal representatives from both firms, Midas' 


    director of corporate communications, and the crisis communications group of a PR firm based in California. Discussion was held, and agreement reached on:</p>


<ul>


    <p><li>Objectives -- Primary: Prevent customer panic and possible &quot;run&quot; on assets. Secondary: Impress Wall Street with wisdom of the deal, increasing value of Midas' stock.</li>





    <p><li>Target Audiences (internal and external) -- including Midas/ Struggling employees, Midas/Struggling customers, Midas/Struggling key community contacts, Midas/Struggling 


        major vendors, Midas' investors and Wall Street contacts. Plus media serving all of the above. EMPLOYEES were perceived as THE most important audience because, for better or worse, 


        employees were the &quot;front line&quot; PR people for both companies. If they were happy with the deal, they would pass that sense of confidence on to others.</li>





    <p><li>Key Messages -- Three &quot;most important for all audiences&quot; messages about business transaction, plus 1-3 additional key messages, as needed, specific to individual audiences. For 


        example, a key message for employees was &quot;you're keeping your job, and with improved benefits.&quot;</li>





    <p><li>Day of Announcement PR Activities -- Letters from CEO's of both firms to every member of every target audience, delivered by the most expeditious method (varied from audience to 


        audience). Press releases and other press materials customized for different types of media (business,consumer, financial, trade). Spokes-persons made available for interviews (after 


        pre-announcement training). Instructions for branch personnel on how to answer inquiries and handle any media who showed up on their doorstep. Teleconference between Midas/Struggling 


        management and Wall Street contacts, including media, while Midas' CEO, CFO and other Investor Relations team members made time to answer calls from the investment community.</p>


    <p>The situation on which this case history is based occurred before the Internet became a PR tool. If it happened today, there 


        would also have been a &quot;virtual newsroom&quot; created online for media use as well as a special page for customers, both of which would have been updated instantly as needed.</li>


    <p><li>Post-Announcement PR Activities -- Ensuring that all important non-media audiences hear of any changes resulting from the merger directly from the company before they were mentioned 


        in the press. Proactively monitoring media interest and providing in-depth briefings to longer-lead journalists. Implementing community relations activities to introduce &quot;the Midas touch&quot; to 


        communities where they would now have branches. Conducting research to ensure that important messages have been received and believed by all target audiences.</li>


</ul>


<p><b><i>[Epilogue]</i></b></p>


<p>Simple. The plan worked. There was no &quot;run on the bank&quot; and Midas' stock went up upon release of the news. Surprises were few and the 


    crisis communications team was able to manage them effectively.</p>

<p><i>Editor's Note: We're going to do something a little different for this issue. Instead of writing &quot;Crisis Manager on Spot&quot; in its usual 


    straight Q&amp;A format, with me providing answers, I'm going to give you, the reader, a chance to answer an excellent, thought-provoking question from William P. Gowen of Gowen 


    Associates in Coconut Grove, Fla., who asks us to recommend the correct procedure/methodology for testing and validating a crisis communications plan. He leads off with this scenario:</i></p>


<ul>


    <p><li>Major Cruise line with over 36,000 total passengers traveling any given time. Over 3,000 land-based employees with an additional 18,000 employees ship-side.</li>


    <p><li>Plan was written in house by a competent senior staff. It is a given that planners addressed all situations using standard methodology to arrive at all possible crisis incidents. Planners 


        have addressed all external crisis situations as well as all internal crisis situations (excluding a financial crisis). In other words, they think they have all bases covered, with no weak links.</li>


    <p><li>Planners have identified and trained required personnel, or provided a pre-cut contract for outside support, such as grief counselors and communication support.</li>


</ul>


<p>Mr. Gowen then asks: &quot;What methodology is used to identify and address the weak points of the plan, and who will be the controlling entity in testing the plan?&quot;</p>


<p>He adds that &quot;to my knowledge there is no formal methodology. I may be wrong ... but don't think so. I know how to do it and I am formalizing it on paper for a plan that I am writing.&quot;</p>


<p>I will publish Mr. Gowen's answer, along with best reader submissions, in my next issue, so send your responses to: <a href="mailto:&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> In the 03.01.02 issue of "Crisis Manager" I wrote of using Secret Shopping Techniques to assess an organization's vulnerabilities and preparedness for crisis.  I invited reader response and two wrote in -- the first with a great prevention tip, given immediately below, and the second with what qualified as "two case histories for the price of one" that are featured in the !MANAGE THIS! section of this ezine, below.  I love it when readers make my job this easy!  And I am ALWAYS looking for new material, so please send in your submissions -- it's a great way to raise your own visibility and even develop new business. If you missed the original story, it's now archived at <a href="http://www.bernsteincrisismanagement.com/nl/crisismgr020301.html" target="_blank">www.bernsteincrisismanagement.com/nl/crisismgr020301.html</a>.</i>
<p><b>Playing Reporter as a Secret Shopping Technique</b><br><i>by Samantha Lee Joos, Account Executive, LarsonO'BrienAcumen, ADV/PR</i></p>
<p>I am currently preparing one of my clients for communicating with the media in a crisis, or any, situation. Part of the preparation is to establish and implement company procedures to direct all media inquires to the company's main media contact. This is especially key because my client has several offices throughout the area and the media could easily call any one of them. Our procedures include forwarding all media inquires to that main media client because she is prepared to respond to those calls.
<p>The secret shopping element is that once these procedures are implemented I will periodically call the different offices and pose as a reporter from one of the local papers. This will help me determine how well our procedures were communicated and how efficiently such calls are handled. I think secret shopping is great way to evaluate and can help give your client a true perspective.
<p><i>Samantha sounds like she has a great future in PR.  You can contact her at LarsonO'BrienAcumen, Pittsburgh, PA, <a href="mailto:&#115&#97&#109&#97&#110&#116&#104&#97&#64&#97&#100&#118&#97&#110&#100&#112&#114&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#115&#97&#109&#97&#110&#116&#104&#97&#64&#97&#100&#118&#97&#110&#100&#112&#114&#46&#99&#111&#109</a>.</i>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="2b`"></a>PLANET FEEDBACK -- A RUMOR CONTROL TOOL</h2>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> as regular readers of the ezine know, I periodically report on services that could be of use to we crisis managers and was recently made aware of PlanetFeedback (www.planetfeedback.com). It appears to have many applications for online rumor control; I haven't yet had the opportunity to employ its services for my clients, but I plan to.  This is how they describe themselves.</i>
<p>PlanetFeedback products have been developed to help organizations across multiple industries cost-effectively obtain and leverage a 360-degree view of consumer opinion.  Our mission is to facilitate faster and easier communication between consumers and companies. PlanetFeedback has developed two web-based technology products that may have immediate applications to Bernstein Crisis Management and your clients' businesses:
<p>ExpressFeedback, our feedback ASP, will enable a company to jump-start its web-based feedback capabilities with an interactive and user-friendly process for consumers that enables them to capture direct feedback in a more usable format.  They can even conduct 1:1 marketing with customized content based on each consumer's particular issue. ExpressFeedback integrates with existing consumer response systems and can incorporate data from phone, fax, mail, and other sources to provide you with one complete view of all your direct consumer feedback. Check out the recent implementations below:

In addition to a new consumer lens for an organization, this can be a reliable early warning system for rumors and/or product issues that can impact one's business. With BrandPulse you can:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Identify and react to changing consumer opinions in real time</li>
<p><li>Monitor and benchmark your performance vs. competitors.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="3`"></a>!MANAGE THIS!</h2>
<p><b>Secret Shopping Helps Prevent Hospital Crises</b><br><i>by Ann Barks, APR, Ann Bark Public Relations</i></p>
<p>I wanted to pass on two of the best examples of secret shopping we did at a hospital where I was the PR director. We were hiring a new chef because our scores for patient satisfaction on food were horrible. He'd never worked in a hospital before, so before he came on board, he entered the hospital as a patient and spent two days on one of the wards. Now, not only did he see exactly how important food became to patients, but he also witnessed how part of the problem with the food was the people who served it - attitude! We immediately did the work we needed on both ends - but changing the menus, etc., took far longer than "blitz" training the servers and educating them to become ambassadors (so to speak) for the entire hospital since they had a rare, easy opportunity to interact with our patients. This was a good group of employees - no one had ever really taken the time to help them see how important their role was to the organization. So we might have just been lucky. But, we saw an immediate spike in the surveys, even before the food was overhauled.
<p>The second example was when we hired a new Chief Information Officer. He spent his first day, before anyone met him, going from department to department as if he were a visitor and seeing how many computers were being left unattended while still logged on to the system and making access to confidential files possible. What an eye-opener for many people - we had prided ourselves on protecting such information but his observances focused much-needed attention on something really important.

<p>Bernstein Crisis Management has formal or informal co-promotional and mutually beneficial business associations with PIER Systems, Inc., PR Newswire's ProfNet service and CustomScoop. No, we can't go into details because that's confidential, proprietary, etc. But our relationship is NOT "arm's distance" and you should know that, since we regularly write about how we're using these services for crisis and issues management. That said, you should also know that Bernstein Crisis Management sought the relationships because its staff is convinced that these services are the best of their kind for Bernstein Crisis Management's needs and those of their clients. If you have any questions about these relationships, please contact Jonathan Bernstein, (626) 825-3838.

<p><b>Ask the Right Questions</b><br><i>by Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>If your primary place of business was completely unavailable as of midnight tonight -- and you had no advance warning:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Would everyone who works there know where to report for work tomorrow and/or how to conduct business remotely?</li>
<p><li>Do you have alternative worksites already identified and contingency plans established that would allow you to move in rapidly?</li>
<p><li>Do you have contact information for ALL your key audiences, internal and external, that is available to you quickly even if you were never able to occupy your primary place of business again? Was the information reviewed and updated in the past 90 days?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the questions we ask in a vulnerability audit.  If you know your vulnerabilities in advance, you can avoid many crises and most certainly minimize the damage from others.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="3`"></a>!MANAGE THIS!</h2>
<p><b>ISP Thwarts Cyber-Terrorists</b>
<br><b>linkLINE Communications Turns Crisis Into PR Success</b><br><i>by Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> this is another of those rare occasions when a crisis has been very public and the client is justifiably proud of its response and willing to share the results with others. As I've told linkLINE's management, their willingness to take some direction on this challenging situation reflects great credit on them; I assured them that I've known other organizations not nearly so willing to "do the right thing."</i>
<p><b>The Crisis</b>
<p>"We think that someone calling himself 'Mr. Zilterio' may have accessed our customer records, to include credit card numbers. He's threatening to reveal that information to our customers and the press if we don't pay him a large amount of money."
<p>That was the initial call I received from Marc Benzakein, one of the founders of linkLINE Communications (<a href="http://www.linkline.com" target="_blank">www.linkline.com</a>), an expanding, relatively small (15,000 subscriber) but profitable Internet service provider based in Mira Loma, California (note: in their business, "profitable" is rare).
<p>In that phone call, and a subsequent meeting with linkLINE's management/crisis response team, I learned that:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>According to federal authorities and information available to anyone who does a search for "Zilterio" on the Internet, the same individual may have extorted as much as $4 billion from other organizations who wanted to sweep the situation under the rug for fear of losing business.</li>
<p><li>linkLINE, with law enforcement direction, had been stringing Zilterio along for a little while identifying how he got past their security. In the process, they traced the bank account to which Zilterio wanted money wired through Russia (where he said he was from) to Yemen, a known hotbed of terrorism.</li>
<p><li>The ISP felt strongly that it was ethically and morally wrong to give in to what could clearly be construed as "cyber-terrorism."</li>
<p><li>linkLINE had taken the steps necessary to ensure that the security hole which Zilterio may have exploited was plugged.</li>
<p><li>A significant loss of customers could be devastating to linkLINE because of its still-small size.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Crisis Response Team Meets</b>
<p>As a crisis response team, we agreed that:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>linkLINE's customers needed to be notified of the threat before Zilterio communicated with them. This meant that the entire "response package" needed to be in place between our Thursday afternoon meeting and the following Monday evening. We all wanted to move even more quickly, but double-checking some security preparations precluded any more haste. The team member in touch with Zilterio felt he could stall him as long as necessary.</li>
<p><li>The best approach, very much in keeping with linkLINE's operating philosophy, was to express compassion for the concern this might cause customers, provide them with information they would need as a consequence of the situation, while also calling for them to unite with linkLINE in combating cyber-terrorism.</li>
<p><li>Close coordination would need to be made with the security offices for the four major credit card companies so that (a) linkLINE customers would have the least-possible work to do regarding the possible exposure of their credit card numbers and (b) that linkLINE's relationships with the credit card companies remained sound.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Pre-Announcement Activities</b>
<p>During three intense days of preparation:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>linkLINE management contacted the four credit card companies, who were very appreciative of linkLINE's proactive response, agreed to put a special watch on linkLINE customer credit card numbers to see if they were fraudulently abused, and assured linkLINE that customers would not be held liable for any such fraud.</li>
<p><li>A Customer Alert letter was drafted for release late in the evening of Monday, March 18. That letter has been posted for "Crisis Manager" readers at:: <a href="http://www.piersystem.com/clients/bernstein/linkline1" target="_blank">http://www.piersystem.com/clients/bernstein/linkline1</a>.txt</li>
<p><li>A press release was drafted for distribution in the early morning of March 19. That release, as an MS-Word doc, is temporarily archived at: <a href="http://www.piersystem.com/clients/bernstein/Linkline2.doc" target="_blank">http://www.piersystem.com/clients/bernstein/Linkline2.doc</a></li>
<p><li>A Customer Q&A was drafted in preparation for posting on linkLINE's website. That Q&A can still be found at: <a href="http://www.linkline.com/corp/securityfaq.asp" target="_blank">http://www.linkline.com/corp/securityfaq.asp</a></li>
<p><li>A special Customer Service Response Guide was created and customer service reps trained on its use.</li>
<p><li>linkLINE's crisis response team identified other key stakeholders, besides customers, who might need to be called or contacted when the news was released, and prepared to make those communications.</li>
<p><li>Marc Benzakein was trained to be the primary spokesperson on the situation, with another member of the team as backup spokesperson.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Announcement and Results</b>
<p>Zilterio did not act during the preparation period, and linkLINE was able to launch its crisis communications campaign.
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>In the late evening of March 18 and early morning of March 19, respectively, the Customer Alert went out by email and the press release by PR Newswire (California circuit only, as 95% of their customers were in-state, and knowing that even the California circuit also goes to Internet news sites and certain other key media).</li>
<p><li>While customer call volume did go up, it was not overwhelming; linkLINE had contingency plans for what to do if it backed up, but the Customer Alert, combined with the Customer Q&A, apparently satisfied the vast majority of customers.</li>
<p><li>Most of the calls and emails that DID come in were highly complimentary of linkLINE's response. Some examples:</li>
<p><li>"In today's world of competition and LOVE of money very few companies are up front when they have a problem that could affect their business. YOU GUYS ARE THE EXCEPTION. Thanks for letting us all know the truth. Because of people like you I feel much safer on the NET. THANKS AGAIN."</li>
<p><li>"I would like to commend you on your handling of the Zilterio blackmail incident. Prompt and full disclosure through email and your website is the exact way to go.  This kind of professionalism makes me happy to continue with linkLINE as my ISP. Nothing is 100% secure; what separates the pros from the rest is the response to a security breach. Your response measured up in every respect."</li>
<p><li>There were some people who were initially very disgruntled, but linkLINE execs did a great job of communicating in a caring and informative manner that made customers more comfortable.</li>
<p><li>A few credit cards were voluntarily (by customers) or involuntarily (by banks, when they were also ATM cards) suspended, but even those customers were understanding. And as part of their preparation, linkLINE had made it easy to switch to another credit card (securely) or use another method of payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, two weeks later, linkLINE had no net loss in customers and has continued to enjoy its usual level of growth.
<p><b>Editor's Note:</b> Unfortunately, Zilterio hasn't stopped doing his thing -- there's a Dow Jones story out today about his attack on another company. Any organization which maintains confidential information on its Internet-accessible servers is vulnerable and would do well to (a) assess its level of vulnerability and (b) be prepared to respond if and when a security breach occurs.  Not merely operationally, but in terms of legally appropriate public relations.

<p><b><i>Q:</i></b> Our in-house counsel doesn't think there's any place for PR in legal matters. How do I convince him otherwise?
<p><b><i>CM:</i></b> Nothing seems to work as well as one attorney talking to another. We maintain a list of attorneys, in-house counsel and external, who are willing to talk to our prospective clients and share their experience working closely with public relations/crisis communications professionals.
<p>I can tell you -- and perhaps this will impact your in-house counsel -- that September 11 and Enron have triggered a high demand for speaking engagements to law firms and legal associations of various kinds (<a href="http://www.bernsteincrisismanagement.com/presentations.html" target="_blank">see the list here</a>). That may be an indication that the legal profession's awareness about the role of public relations in legal matters is increasing.

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> I have been fascinated by the results of the PRSA Economic Confidence Study done by Equation Research, completed in August 2002.

A number of findings are very significant for those who seek to prevent or minimize business reputation crises and I will start to report those in this issue, continuing in future issues. The first finding wasn't ranked this way in the survey -- they just gave the raw results and mean scores.  Look at where company officials rank! And at who is considered more credible about company financial info.</i>

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Crisis Manager reader Charlie McDonald wrote to me earlier this month suggesting that we run articles on crisis simulation, the vital "testing" element of crisis preparedness. I said "good idea, you want to write one?"  Charlie and I both know that there's a lot more to say on this subject -- he edited his original 3,600-word piece down to what you see below -- and I've asked my resident simulation guru, Phil Cogan, to give you a follow-up article soon.</i>
<p><b>A Little Exercise Keeps Your Crisis Management Organization in Shape</b><br><i>by Charles McDonald</i></p>
<p><p>Crisis management planning is important for all types of companies. Crisis management professionals have known this all along; now many corporations are developing plans for the first time or revisiting plans with a new eye towards previously unacknowledged threats. But after planning, an additional step is required to ensure an organization can successfully respond to a crisis -- the exercise program. Without regular exercises, crisis management plans will do little to help in a crisis, and can even provide a false sense of preparedness. It is the experience gained in crisis exercises that builds a company's response capabilities. The types of exercises used to improve crisis response capabilities are briefly described below.
<p><b>Notification and Activation</b>
<p>This exercise tests the company's ability to:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Receive information about a potential crisis</li>
<p><li>Assess its impact and determine the response level warranted</li>
<p><li>Activate the crisis teams, i.e., find them and get them to the crisis room.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are done off-hours to assess call out procedures and determine how long it takes to assemble the teams in their assigned areas. The drill begins with a call to the identified crisis response number and ends when the team is assembled. These drills are simple to design and conduct and should be run at least twice a year.
<p><b>The Tabletop</b>
<p>The objectives of this type of exercise are to:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Provide crisis teams with experience in executing the plans in a learning environment, without the pressure of a real-time exercise.</li>
<p><li>Develop an understanding of the team's role in the overall corporate response.</li>
<p><li>In multi-team exercises, test team integration and identify gaps and overlaps in roles.</li>
<p><li>Identify areas where additional work is indicated. During assessment, four possibilities exist for each issue and role.</li>

<ol start="1" type="1">
<p><li>Response was effective and plan was followed (desired result)</li>
<p><li>Response was effective but plan was not followed (plan needs revision)</li>
<p><li>Response was ineffective but plan was followed (plan needs revisions)</li>
<p><li>Response was ineffective and plan was not followed (training needed -- plan revision may be needed)</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<p>A tabletop exercise is a pre-scheduled meeting. Notification and activation are not tested.  Facilities and equipment are not involved. A tabletop exercise introduces a team or teams to crisis management concepts in a learning environment using a discussion based approach.  A realistic scenario facilitates the discussion. No activity occurs outside the meeting room.  No phone calls are made or received, no press briefings are held, and no action is actually taken.
<p>Initially, tabletops should be done with individual teams. First, the corporate team is challenged with a significant crisis scenario. Each team member will realize what resources and actions would be required to mount an effective response within his or her discipline. Next, supporting teams, the communications team or the legal team, run tabletops using the same scenario. Once these teams have conducted individual crisis exercises, a full-scale corporate tabletop exercise is conducted, where the concepts of integration between the teams are learned and experienced.  The exercise will test integration of leadership, communications, organizational structure, roles and responsibilities.
<p>To conduct a tabletop exercise, the leader begins by presenting each "player" with a scenario to read and make any personal notes or observations.  The exercise leader then takes the teams on a "walk through" of their initial response activities. Discussions about how to respond will naturally occur and help balance roles, responsibilities and expectations as well as reveal the type of resources required. The process is repeated, using a later point in the time to address issues that occur after the initial event.
<p>An evaluation report is created and distributed which outlines the strengths and improvement areas in the plans and makes recommendations. These are moderately complex exercises to design and conduct and should be done on an annual basis.
<p><b>The Simulation</b>
<p>The objectives of this type of exercise are to:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Improve the team's ability to handle a real business unit or corporate crisis.</li>
<p><li>Validate the team plan under simulated real-time, dynamic crisis conditions.</li>
<p><li>Identify strengths and weaknesses in the plan and the team members in an "under tension" situation.</li>
<p><li>Allow the team members to experience the emotional and resource issues of a crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simulation involves two groups - the "players," who are crisis team members responding to the incident scenario, and the "simulators," who are "producing" the incident, controlling the drill and observing and evaluating the response. The drill moves in real time as simulators place information via phone, fax, and in person into the players' rooms.  The information revealed to the players about the scenario is dynamic; changing based on the decisions and actions of the players.
<p>The simulation team acts as the entire universe outside the players' room; thus while responding to the "incident," the players always contact a member of the simulation team.  That is, if they want to contact the president, site, their family, technical resources or other members of the business, they call specific phone numbers to reach the simulators who play those roles.  Simulators also play the roles of the media, public, regulators, customers, competitors, government officials, activists, emergency responders and so on. At the end of the drill, a complete debriefing is conducted including the players, simulators, and evaluators.
<p>As with tabletop exercises, simulations should be progressively inclusive, starting with individual teams and broadening scope to multi-team then company wide exercises, with progressively less of the corporate response simulated. These exercises are very complex to design and conduct.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<p>Exercising is the final, but most important step in developing quality crisis management capabilities. Since exercise design, conduct and evaluation is a specialized profession, most companies do not have the in-house expertise to execute quality exercises. Perhaps that is why companies often do not follow through with this aspect of crisis preparedness. But this is penny-wise and pound-foolish to use a clich&eacute;. Looking at it another way, it's like having a life insurance policy without a beneficiary -- someone else will decide what happens to your investment.

<p><b><i>Q: </i></b>I'm with a government organization and so much of what you publish here seems to be corporate-oriented, I have a hard time relating and hesitate to share your articles with my peers and superiors because they'd say the information didn't apply to us. Could you write more about government-sector crisis management?
<p><b><i>CM: </i></b>Phil Cogan and I try very hard to use the word "organization" versus "company" in our original articles because so much of the theory and practice we espouse applies equally to both the public and private sector. Most of Phil's professional life, as many of you know, was in the government (primarily FEMA). We have certainly had articles that came directly from government public affairs -- and will soon have an excellent article written jointly by a military public affairs officer, a PR agency pro, and a corporate v.p.  If you look for the similarities, versus the differences, I suspect that you'll find applicable lessons in most of our material.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="mt"></a>!MANAGE THIS!</h2>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> my thanks to the public relations department at Sanitarium Health Food for allowing me to reprint this instructive case history from Australia, reminiscent of the Odwalla and Tylenol recalls in the U.S.</i>
<p><b>Sanitarium Health Food Contamination Threat</b></p>
<p>Sanitarium Health Food Company received a letter threatening contamination of its 'liquid products' on the morning of Monday, 29 June 1998. It was, in the words of CEO Robert Smith, "every food company's worst nightmare".
<p>Fortunately, Sanitarium had a crisis management plan in place. Within an hour its Emergency Response Team was meeting and making decisions. The ERT comprised five senior managers - the CEO, Chief Operating Officer, General Manager-Sales & Marketing, General Manager-Technical Services and Public Relations Manager. ERT meetings were also attended by two crisis management experts from The Rowland Company, Sanitarium's public relations consultancy.
<p>The first task was to establish the facts and to seek advice from the Police and Medical authorities. Although expert advice was that the risk was remote, the ERT decided that consumer safety had to be the number one priority. The Company therefore instituted an immediate national recall of all its beverage products - So Good, Up&Go and Fruit Juices - from supermarket shelves.
<p>The first 24 hours of the crisis were spent making key decisions and organising communications to staff, retailers, other business partners and the public (via the media). The response from the trade was prompt and efficient with the major supermarket chains completing the recall within hours of being notified.
<p>Sanitarium's CEO travelled from the Company's headquarters in Berkeley Vale, Central Coast to Sydney to handle media interviews. The story was the lead item on TV news in the evening and there was heavy print and radio coverage for the next few days. In addition to all the editorial coverage, product recall advertisements were placed in the major metropolitan newspapers.
<p>According to tracking research 80 per cent of Australians were aware of the recall by the end of the first week. The consumer hotline received 12,000 enquires, necessitating an overflow facility with an external service provider.
<p>After the initial public announcement the ERT continued to meet daily to share information such as staff, trade and consumer feedback, media updates, further updates from the police, to make decisions and to approve further communications.
<p>The focus of attention moved to what Sanitarium was doing to check its products and when they would return. This was of particular concern to many lactose intolerant people who rely on dairy alternatives such as So Good, the leading brand of soy milk in Australia.
<p>An interim media announcement was made to communicate that Sanitarium was conducting an exhaustive inspection and testing process, involving over 300,000 recalled items which would then be destroyed. Only then would the Company be prepared to bring its products back to supermarket shelves.
<p>The ERT had also formed a special Back to Market team to ensure a successful return of the beverage products to supermarket shelves, dealing with manufacturing, logistics, distribution, trade and customer information.
<p>An integrated communications campaign was developed, including a series of TV and press ads featuring CEO Robert Smith who had been the public face of the Company throughout the crisis. And on 17 July a media conference was held to announce the return of Sanitarium beverages to supermarket shelves.
<p>520 editorial media items were generated during the course of the crisis, providing over 73 million opportunities to see, hear, or read about Sanitarium. The coverage was fair, accurate, and sympathetic towards the Company.
<p>Sanitarium has estimated the cost of the recall and disposal of withdrawn stock at $1-2m, plus a further $2m in lost sales. However, the financial considerations were secondary to consumer safety and the safeguarding of the Company's reputation as an ethical, customer focused organisation.
<p>According to tracking research 95 per cent said that consumer safety was the reason for the recall, 92 per cent said they trusted Sanitarium and 90 per cent said they considered Sanitarium had handled the recall well or very well.

<p><i>Major Terrorism Events & Terrorism Timeline</i>
<br><b>by Claire B. Rubin et al</b>
<p>For those of us who choose to learn from the experiences of others, "Major Terrorism Events and Their U.S. Outcomes," a white paper offered through George Washington University's Institute for Crisis, Disaster, and Risk Management is a wise investment of $20. It provides lessons learned from an examination and analysis of terrorism acts and major disasters over the past two decades. Not surprisingly to those of us who are crisis managers, many of the "gee, I should have thought of that" lessons from 9/11 were also readily available through previous experiences.  The publisher also offers a four-color graphic outline of the various crises available for a mere $5 more.  Order at <a href="http://www.disaster-timeline.com" target="_blank">http://www.disaster-timeline.com</a>.
<p><b>2002 Crisis Communications White Paper</b>
<p>The 2002 Crisis Communications White Paper from Best Practices in Business Communications does a remarkably good job, in 60 pages, of summarizing the state of crisis communications today. The changes in practice and consciousness that have been prompted by both corporate disasters and the horrendous lessons of 9/11.  It includes instructional and educational material on crisis preparedness, management and analysis.
<p>Some of the report's sections include:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Nine Steps to Crisis Preparation, Management, and Analysis</li>
<p><li>What Crises Challenge Corporate Communications?</li>
<p><li>Terrorism</li>
<p><li>Market Upheavals</li>
<p><li>Shareholder Uncertainty</li>
<p><li>Leadership Turnover</li>
<p><li>Mergers and Acquisitions failure</li>
<p><li>Product Recalls</li>
<p><li>Environmental Accidents</li>
<p><li>Workplace Violence</li>
<p><li>Natural Disasters</li>
<p><li>Importance of Top-Down Crisis Management</li>
<p><li>Best Practice Media Relations Tactics</li>
<p><li>Branding and Crisis Management</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus four case histories about how some leading companies adjusted in the days after 9/11.  Given the length of the white paper, no single subject gets a large amount of ink, but this publication would be an excellent primer for any CEO or head of corporate communications.
<p><i>The 2002 Crisis Communications White paper, $100 for PRSA members, $150.00 for non-members.  Non-members purchase at <a href="http://www.bpincc.com/shopcart/product.asp?intProdID=6" target="_blank">http://www.bpincc.com/shopcart/product.asp?intProdID=6</a>, PRSA members have to call Shane McLaughlin, 202.463.3780, to place their discounted order.</i>
<p><b>Disaster Recovery Yellow Pages</b>
<p>The 2003 edition of the Disaster Recovery Yellow Pages from the Systems Audit Group (<a href="http://www.disaster-help.com" target="_blank">www.disaster-help.com</a>) is exactly as named: a 300-page compendium of approximately 3,000 paid listings from organizations providing disaster-related support services in 255 categories.  It is an excellent starting point for identifying the vendors who could serve your organization before, during or after a disaster -- something you'd best do now, not when the building is falling down.
<p>It is important to note that there is no way to tell anything about the quality of the advertisers' services simply from a directory.  You must do your research and check references.  I have heard very positive overall feedback from individuals who purchased last year's edition.
<p>Finally, the publishers are offering "Crisis Manager" readers 10% off the purchase price -- normally $98 for either the hard copy or CD-ROM version, with further discount for ordering both and/or bulk orders.  If you want the "Crisis Manager" discount, you must send email with your phone number to <a href="mailto:&#100&#105&#115&#97&#115&#116&#101&#114&#64&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#110&#101&#119&#115&#108&#101&#116&#116&#101&#114&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#100&#105&#115&#97&#115&#116&#101&#114&#64&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#110&#101&#119&#115&#108&#101&#116&#116&#101&#114&#46&#99&#111&#109</a> and someone from Systems Audit Group will contact you to manually process your order (their online order system doesn't currently accommodate special discount offers).

<p>The Internet can be a powerful weapon for crisis management, but without preparation and planning it is simply another a poorly hoisted petard.

<p><b>Breaking Crisis Lesson: Power Outage in NE US & Canada</b></p>
<p>Just as I was finalizing this newsletter, we were all hearing and reading the news of the massive power outage in the Northeastern quadrant of the U.S. and parts of Canada. No terrorists in sight, no natural disaster, just good old "failure of a key infrastructure component." Regardless of the cause, the effect is the same -- widespread disruption or even complete interruption of services all across the private and public sector, for varying lengths of time.
<p>Lessons for Crisis Managers:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>All organizations need to assume that at some time or another they will lose the use of one or more utilities for a long enough period of time to cause damage to their operations. They need to plan for how to transition such times in a manner that minimizes interruption and reflects well on their reputation.</li>
<p><li>You don't have to be at the scene of a crisis to be impacted by a crisis.  How many thousands of air travelers whose planes were going to, coming from or passing the affected areas are painfully aware of that fact today? How many air cargoes aren't going to arrive on schedule.  What will happen to certain organizations because people or cargoes can't get where they're supposed to be? How many phone lines and systems are overwhelmed by people trying to reach those in the affected areas, and what are the negative impacts of the phone system being too busy? Those are just a few of the dominoes falling into each other at this moment. Heck, what's the impact of "merely" having a much higher percentage of hot and frustrated people interacting with each other, to include those in customer service?</li>
<p><li>Organizations with good backup plans in this situation will shine, with some commercial entities possibly even gaining business that couldn't be handled by their less prepared competitors.</li>
<p><li>Preparation is NOT an option, it's a necessity, Quoniam Stercus Accidit (Because Shit Happens).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Every Crisis is An Opportunity</b>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> I'm going to take apart a recent press release to demonstrate the opportunity lost by the issuer, an organization clearly in crisis.  Comments in brackets are mine, followed by my usual "Lessons for Crisis Managers."</i>
<p>NEW YORK, Jul 30, 2003 -- IMPATH Inc. (Nasdaq: IMPH) today announced that the Audit Committee of the Company has initiated an investigation into possible accounting irregularities involving its accounts receivable which the Company believes have been overstated. The Company noted that given the preliminary stage of the investigation, it cannot determine the financial impact but believes that it will be material.
<p><i>Editor's Note: This was followed by three longish paragraphs full of details of the problem and announcing the resignation of its VP of Finance and Corporate Controller. Then, after a total of 446 words, the following paragraph started.</i>
<p>Carter H. Eckert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, "As we have said in the past, the Company has a zero tolerance policy on these matters at every level in the organization. Our commitment to our clients and shareholders remains of paramount importance. We are taking swift and decisive actions to assess the situation, determine the nature and extent of the financial impact and implement the appropriate remedial steps and controls to ensure that we provide financial reports that are accurate and reliable.
<p>"As we delve into these critical issues, we will continue to focus on a targeted growth strategy around our core Physician Services business. We are dedicated to implementing improved operating strategies and delivering high-quality service to our clients with the goal of improving the lives of cancer patients."
<p><i>Editor's Note: There were then another 551 words of corporate description and legalese.</i>
<p>Lessons for Crisis Managers:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Don't bury important messages -- it's been my experience that putting a compassionate message near the front of an announcement tremendously enhances reception of the factual information which follows.</li>
<p><li>Include -- in your press releases and other statements -- a personalized message of compassion.  Not merely the standard "the Company has a zero tolerance policy on these matters at every level in the organization. Our commitment to our clients and shareholders remains of paramount importance," because unfortunately those are used so frequently that the public perceives them as trite.  Rather, a very HUMAN statement along the lines of:</li>
<p>"We understand how our clients and shareholders might feel concern at this point, which we deeply regret.  We are committed to doing all that we can to learn the facts necessary to correcting any errors and reassuring those who care about IMPATH."</li>
<p><li>Ensure that crisis-savvy PR professionals are involved in decisions regarding crisis response, message drafting and positioning.

<p><b>Quoniam Stercus Accidit -- "Because Shit Happens"</b>
<p>Seeing my new t-shirt, a friend said, "OH, Crisis Manager University, where's that?  And what does that Latin motto mean?" After I'd explained that the "University" is an online community -- and the motto means "Because Shit Happens," -- he offered to buy it from me, on the spot. He actually said, "hey, by that definition, all of us are Crisis Managers!"  I refrained from saying "no shit."
<p>The new Crisis Manager University (CMU) Bookstore has been launched at <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/crisismanager" target="_blank">www.cafeshops.com/crisismanager</a>, where you can order t-shirts and baseball caps with the CMU name and motto on them. If you are interested in quantity pricing, write to me separately -- the specialty product vendor who provides this storefront doesn't have a means for me to do that online.
<p>More serious crisis management training and educational materials remain available for purchase at <a href="http://www.thecrisismanager.com" target="_blank">www.thecrisismanager.com</a>, to include "Keeping the Wolves at Bay: A Media Training Manual.
<p><b>Links Anyone?</b>
<p>We all want to be in Google's top 10, and having higher numbers of links is an important contributing factor. I'm interested in hearing from "Crisis Manager" readers who have well-trafficked websites and who might want to exchange links.  I also want to remind all of you that you're welcome to reprint content from past issues of "Crisis Manager" on your sites as long as you provide appropriate credit and a link to the source.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="mt"></a>!MANAGE THIS!</h2>
<p><b>Managing Online Rumors</b><br><i>by Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>A reader recently wrote:
<blockquote>"In this age of weblogs and other postings, and aside from the usual 'behavior' guidelines for employees, could you provide guidelines for what is appropriate to engage in with respect to Net postings about company business, products, etc.?  Among other concerns, we don't want to have a cacophony of conflicting views that might blur our various official messages.  Thanks for any thoughts or examples." </blockquote>
<p>First, let me note that I'm not an attorney and so I can't speak to the legal considerations inherent in the question. But I obviously work with attorneys enough to know I should issue that caveat. However, from a reputation management/PR perspective, here are some suggested guidelines that have proven effective.  Organizations should:
<p>1.  Monitor what's being said about them online AT LOCATIONS CONSIDERED CREDIBLE BY THEIR STAKEHOLDERS, internal AND external.
<p>2.  Don't make assumptions about what sites/discussion lists/etc. are credible to your stakeholders.  Ask them. You may be surprised.
<p>3.  Track any trends which appear to be developing -- e.g., particular subjects, allegations and/or damaging facts which recur with increasing frequency, possibly across multiple locations.  Those trends may tell you anything from "you're doing something wrong that you have to fix" to "folks THINK you're doing something wrong so you'd better say something in the appropriate venue or, by default, they'll assume their perceptions are accurate."
<p>4.  Seldom, very seldom, respond directly to rumors, allegations, complaints directly in the same public venue where they appear. This often encourages fiery and unpleasant retorts (commonly called "flames"), if not from the person to whom you're responding then from other users that only cause further harm. Instead, IF the venue involved (e.g., an online discussion board/bulletin board service) allows you to send email directly to the message poster, do that -- send a message along the following lines (this is an actual example from a collection of "form" response we created for one of our clients, with information deleted/modified to protect its identity):
<blockquote><p>Dear _______:
<p>Because we very much care about customer opinion, we regularly monitor online message boards and saw your posting at http://xxx.com.  We wanted to provide you with some information.
<p>I am sorry you have had trouble with your Brand X Widget. To receive top performance you have to have fresh ultra batteries. Also, I want to apologize for you not getting a response to your e-mails. Unfortunately, there was a period of time where we were upgrading our software and it caused some problems with our e-mail service.  Since that time this problem has been corrected and the e-mails sent to Customer Service are answered promptly.
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to call our Technical Support Department at 800-999-9999.  Alternately, if you give us your phone number by reply e-mail, we would be happy to call you.
<p>Best Regards,
<p>Mark Generic
<br>Customer Service
<br>Brand X Inc.</blockquote>
<p>5.  There are times when it IS appropriate to respond directly at the online site, but those are decisions have to be made very carefully, come from a source respected at the site involved, and be structured to encourage response off-site (by email or phone).
<p>6.  As implied by your question, it is important that messages to all stakeholders be consistent, regardless of whether they're made online or offline, to internal or external contacts.  All organizations should have a planned and controlled "authorized spokesperson" policy.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="ped"></a>PLAIN ENGLISH DISCLOSURE</h2>
<p>Bernstein Crisis Management has formal or informal co-promotional and mutually beneficial business associations with a number of the services we mention periodically in this newsletter. No, we can't go into details because that's confidential, proprietary, etc. But our relationship is NOT "arm's distance" and you should know that, since we regularly write about these services as we use them for crisis and issues management or other purposes. That said, you should also know that Bernstein Crisis Management sought the relationships because its staff is convinced that these services are the best of their kind for Bernstein Crisis Management's needs and those of their clients. If you have any questions about these relationships, please contact Jonathan Bernstein, (626) 825-3838.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="jat"></a>JUST A THOUGHT</h2>
<p>You read it here first.
<p>I believe that some of the country's best investigative reporters -- at the L.A. Times, some major news magazines, and others -- are quietly conducting exhaustive research to find a "smoking gun" that will implicate Governor-elect Schwarzenegger in wrongdoing which is undeniable.  The LA Times staff is, no doubt, feeling chagrined about how its reporting created negative backlash, while other reporters will be challenged to do what the Times hasn't done. The California fires have no doubt distracted those assigned to this task for a while, but I believe they'll return to it once the disaster focus is no longer required. If there are, in fact, any skeletons, the Schwarzenegger team had better be getting prepared.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="cmu"></a>CRISIS MANAGER UNIVERSITY</h2>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> I'm delighted to present readers with two thought-provoking and educational articles by returning authors Gerald Baron and Karen Friedman.  The uses of the Internet for internal and external communication, Gerald's area of expertise, are clearly continuing to expand exponentially.  While Karen, a renowned media trainer, offers insights about media relations which fly in the face of some people's "gut" feelings.</i>
<p><b>WestFarm Foods Case Study</b><br><i>by Gerald Baron</i></p>
<p>WestFarm Foods is one of the largest privately held companies in Washington State and a powerhouse in the agriculture industry of the Pacific Northwest. It is a cooperative owned by over 700 dairy farmers and produces $1.3 billion worth of dairy products per year.
<p>The last few years have been exceptionally challenging financially and the company faced difficult negotiations with its labor unions. The concessions the company was asking for from the unions were significant and the union representatives were not sounding optimistic. As the contract deadline approached, the company prepared to continue operating its eleven different perishable products plants with replacement workers if necessary, and prepared to communicate with the media, employees, key stakeholders and the public about the status of negotiations.
<p>The communication preparations included activating the company's PIER virtual communication center, which had been previously purchased to help manage public information in case of a crisis. The difficulties of the labor situation constituted a significant crisis and the company's plans and communication technology were put to the test.
<p>A story came out in one local paper as the negotiations were moving to their climax. It included comments from both the company representative and a union representative. But it also included detailed background information about comparative labor rates, extremely difficult market conditions faced by the company, and rationale behind some of the concessions requested. In other words, it made a clear and reasonable case for why the company needed to hold this line.
<p>Within a week after the story appeared, a settlement was reached in the plant in this community and several others. A devastating company-wide strike was averted and later labor action was limited to two of the company's eleven facilities. Whether the story had anything to do with the settlement or not is speculation, but there is no doubt that it created a public atmosphere of understanding for the difficult position of the company. Where did the newspaper get this information? From the company's PIER website which was managed as an integral part of the virtual communication system.
<p>As the difficult labor negotiation situation moved toward crisis, the company launched a site specifically to provide information about the negotiations. The first item added was a detailed "white paper" that laid out the conditions the company faced, how it compared to other companies in labor rates, how other companies in similar industries were changing to meet tightening margins (such as outsourcing), and why rising labor costs were making the company's future questionable. This information provided the basis for more than one newspaper report.
<p>While this may make a strong case for providing good and timely information via a website, this particular company went considerably beyond that. The company's PIER virtual communication center included contact lists of the people whose opinion about the company really mattered. This included reporters, shareholders, employees, major customers and suppliers, industry associations, plant neighbors and more. Whenever there were significant new developments in the on-going labor negotiations, the communication team (one outside contractor, one administrative support person, and the vice president of communication) could instantly draft, edit, approve, upload to the website AND distribute to any and all lists by email or fax. Because they could manage all communication via browser, 24/7 communication management became very doable. The communications manager, for example, did much of the work from her home or office outside of the company without any limitations of not being able to access information or lists within the company's LAN.
<p>This proved particularly useful when the negotiations took a difficult turn. The negotiators left the table and a letter went out from the union leadership to its members that indicated the company had decided to initiate a lockout. Rumors were flying; the union claimed the company was operating in bad faith and had pulled out of negotiations. The union leaders either misunderstood or distorted the facts. The company communicators quickly put out on the site the company's true position versus what had been presented as the company's position in the union leader's letter. The headline was: "Dispelling Rumors." The fast response, made possible by the communication center, enabled the company to put a quick end to a potentially damaging rumor.
<p>One burdensome little (sometimes enormous) job when everything seems to be hitting the fan, is keeping up with inquiries and with the people who want to be kept informed. The communication center facilitates this process. Interested site viewers can add themselves to the mailing list from the website, selecting the appropriate contact category they belong to. They can submit inquiries that are logged and tracked within the center and are combined with others that come in via telephone. The managers can see at any time the nature of the questions, how they are being answered and how quickly. After all, the first thing we are taught about communications is that it is a two-way street. The communication center handles Web communications, outgoing email/fax communications and inquiries with complete integration."
<p>Even several weeks into the on-going labor strife, the company's labor negotiations website was receiving a high rate of traffic and numerous inquiries and comments. As you may imagine, not all of them were worthy of a dignified response. The labor negotiations site was accessed via a highly visible link on the company's site, but the significantly increased Web traffic did not threaten the company's normal Internet services because the PIER site is maintained on separate crisis-capable servers able to withstand millions of hits and with very high levels of security.
<p>Lessons learned? The work that went into preparing the communication center with contact information on key audiences and background information about the company proved invaluable. It saved a tremendous amount of work at the time when resources were stretched to the limit. The ability of non-technically oriented communication managers and support staff to be able to fully manage Web content and simultaneously distribute information to key audiences proved very important, particularly when the rumors were flying. Virtual communication management provides access to all tools and materials via a browser that makes it possible to work anywhere, anytime (with all the good and bad that comes with that). Finally, this situation once again shows what is becoming commonplace in corporate communications, crisis or not: that the Web and the Internet are firmly established as the place where not only is the information to be found but where also most of the work is done.

<p><b>The Press Isn't the Problem:</b>
<br><b>Managing Communications During a Media Frenzy</b><br><i>by Karen Friedman</i></p>
<p>There is a comic strip that hangs in my office. The punch line says; "If at first you don't succeed, blame the media!" I chuckle every time I see it because blaming the media is almost as All-American as Monday night football and probably with good reason, right? After all, reporters dig and interfere. They hardly ever get the facts straight and they have this vulture mentality that requires them to crash all kinds of parties. They're only interested in ratings, allow sales departments to drive story content and they don't seem to care about ruining reputations. After all, if it bleeds, it leads as the saying goes.
<p>I will not argue with the criticism. As a veteran reporter, I shoved many microphones in faces full of grief and have overstayed my welcome in numerous neighborhoods. I can tell you from experience that even if there is nothing new to report; news editors and producers will insist that you look for new angles to keep the story alive. Take the O.J. Simpson media frenzy, the Monica Lewinsky story, or the Kobe Bryant sex scandal to name a few. You might think there is nothing else happening in the world.
<p>While blaming the media may be a popular pasttime, let's not overlook the real problem which happens to be attitude...not theirs, but yours.  Regardless of media shortcomings, the media doesn't create your crisis. They simply report it. For many, this might be considered synonymous. After all, if they didn't report other people's problems, incorrect facts, negative comments or hearsay, then someone's credibility might not be damaged.
<p>However, let's approach this another way. If your seven-year-old child asked you for the car keys, would you throw them over and let him get behind the wheel? If your employee walked into your office and told you she was taking over, would you leave without a fight?  Reporters are no different. They can only walk all over you if you let them. So, instead of complaining that they are ruining your reputation, that other companies received better coverage during negative events or that no one is reporting your side of the story, perhaps you should consider swimming with the tide instead of against it.
<p>To do this, you need to understand a reporter's job:
<ol type="1">
<p><li>It is not their job to protect your reputation.</li>
<p><li>It is not their job to advance your career.</li>
<p><li>It is not their job to ask questions to help you say what you want to say.</li>
<p><li>It is not their job to write the story you think should be told.</li>
<p><li>It is not their job to include everything you told them.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a situation unexpectedly thrusts your company or event into the spotlight, stop focusing on what others are saying and start focusing on what you want to say. Figure out how you are going to solve the problem and then keep the media informed so they can be a resource that will keep the public accurately informed. Once you do this, you will be perceived as an advocate who is managing difficult circumstances instead of someone who is just trying to defend their actions. If you want to further your own agenda, then you need to fuel reporter's tanks with high-octane information.
<p>For starters, media motives are pretty predictable. They ask questions their readers, viewers or listeners would ask such as:
<ol type="1">
<p><li>What happened?</li>
<p><li>Why did it happen?</li>
<p><li>Was anyone hurt?</li>
<p><li>Could this have been prevented?</li>
<p><li>Has this ever happened before?</li>
<p><li>What are you doing about it?</li>
<p><li>When will it be resolved?</li>
<p><li>How will you prevent this from happening in the future?</li>
<p><li>Did you know this was going to happen?</li>
<p><li>What would you like to say to (those affected)?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think about these questions in advance, you will realize that you can quickly provide information and reassure audiences you are acting in their best interest. Organizations that understand this also understand the necessity of preparing in advance so when an adverse event occurs, they control the crisis instead of letting the crisis control them. Here are some suggestions:
<p><b>Promptly Prepare</b>
<p>Even if you believe a problem will never become public, you need to fix it as fast as you can. You should develop talking points, tactics, strategies and designate a spokesperson. That way, if the media does call, you are prepared to answer questions. Good media training for spokespeople is also a must!
<p><b>Crisis Calls</b>
<p>If you aren't sure whether to call the media, ask yourself the following questions:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Is the public in jeopardy?</li>
<p><li>If the media reported this first, would public trust be jeopardized?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer yes, you're playing a dangerous game of roulette. Consider notifying the media before they find out and contact you. This way, you are taking charge instead of allowing others to define the story.
<p><b>Announce Action</b>
<p>About a year ago, I worked with a company that fell victim to a terrible fire. This company did everything right. They set up shelters, provided food and clothing, worked closely with authorities, provided long term temporary housing, and worked hand in hand with the American Red Cross. Yet, they never shared this with the media so it was never reported.
<p><b>Manage Messages</b>
<p>Write down the three or four points you want to communicate and do it! When being interviewed, don't wait for the reporter to ask you a question to trigger those points.
<p><b>Public Perception</b>
<p>Stories are almost always about people who are affected by something that happened. That's why victims are often seen at the top of a story following a response from the company that is usually aired or printed later in the story. If you are not perceived as concerned or acting in someone else's best interest, the story will then become about you.
<p>Last year, I worked with a well-known company that was unexpectedly forced to slash healthcare benefits. Longtime employees were angry, skeptical and scared. It never became a news story because the company went out of its way to take care of those affected by the cuts. They provided training, education, opened hot lines, set up question and answer sessions, provided detailed brochures, specialized websites, offered other benefit packages and always kept the lines of communication open. Employees were still upset but didn't call the media because they were reassured by a company acting in its best interests.
<p><b>Truth Talks</b>
<p>Try to provide as much information as possible without breaching security or confidentiality issues. You want to stay in front of the information so you are delivering it and not responding to what others have heard. If you don't have an answer, simply say so, but offer to provide updates as information becomes available.
<p>Unfortunately, when news breaks and there is a rush to cover it, inaccurate facts are inadvertently reported. If you don't contact the media to correct the information, you have no one to blame except yourself.

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Regular contributor Judy Hoffman has just updated and expanded her book, <i>Keeping Cool on the Hot Seat</i>, which is great news for those of us whose pants sometimes catch on fire. Once again, she has given me kind permission to reprint a section of her book for your enjoyment and education.</i>
<p><b>Going "Above And Beyond"</b><br><i>by Judy Hoffman, from <i>Keeping Cool on the Hot Seat</i></i></p>
<p>You have probably heard the military phrase that someone went "above and beyond the call of duty."  This is also an important concept in media relations.
<p>Let us assume that you are prepared to cooperate with the media if -- or I should say when -- they come to call. You will give them the information that they need to write their story. But I'd like you to consider doing even more.
<p>Let's say you become aware of a situation that is building in your organization or your industry. You think that it is likely to come to the attention of the media at some point. Why not proactively broach the subject?  If you do, you can achieve three important things:
<p>(1)  The media immediately gets the sense that this issue cannot be all that bad.
<p>(2)  It takes all the joy out of a reporter's desire to engage in investigative muckraking.
<p>(3)  It provides you with the opportunity to be the one who shapes the story.
<p><b>How It Works</b>
<p>Let me give you an example. In 1978, the chemical industry had to comply with legislation known as the Superfund Amendment and Re-authorization Act (SARA), which required companies to report their emissions of certain chemicals to the air, water, and land. The catchy name for this data was the Toxic Release Inventory or TRI.
<p>I vividly remember the discussion that occurred within the industry. There was a great deal of fear and trepidation about how the media was going to report on this data once it was released on July 1st. Surely, it was said, when reporters saw what appeared to be large volumes of pollutants being discharged, there would be sensationalistic headlines and extremely negative stories. The only publication requirement at that time was that the data had to be submitted to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), a governmental body at the county level. Back then, most LEPC's were like ours -- not well organized. As an unfunded mandate, it had neither sufficient staff nor money to be effective. We recognized that the LEPC would be hard pressed to properly organize all of the TRI data they would be receiving. We surmised that, if a concerned citizen requested TRI information from the LEPC, it would take them a while to fulfill the request. Some managers cautioned, "Wait and see if anybody asks for it. Why go borrowing trouble?"
<p>As Manager of Public Affairs, external communications were my responsibility. I was confident that the public would want to know about our TRI data. Before I went to work at the chemical company, I had been a member of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters (LWV). Environmental protection was one of the planks in their platform. I knew that, as soon as it became known that this data had to be filed, one of my LWV colleagues would be asking for it. I also knew that undue delays in obtaining that information would lead to frustration and anger. I imagined negative stories in the LWV monthly bulletin and the local newspapers as well.
<p>To avoid the appearance that the company was attempting to hide this data, I suggested that we publish the information and place it openly in local municipal halls and libraries. I still remember the shocked looks on the faces of several members of the management team when I brought up the subject. To their credit, however, they were willing to discuss it -- especially once the company president said the idea was worthy of further consideration.
<p>What eventually developed was a 40-page notebook. The TRI data was included, of course. However, we were able to present it in a way that we thought would be more palatable -- breaking down annual air emission figures to pounds per hour, for instance. We also made sure there was a clear statement that these were estimated figures and an explanation of why we were confident that the estimates vastly overstated the actual case. We also used the opportunity to provide local citizens with accurate scientific definitions of some of the scary sounding words like "hazardous," "toxic," and "carcinogen," which they would probably be hearing or reading when the media began reporting on the TRI data after July 1st.
<p>Surrounding the actual TRI data were chapters about the company's history, products, processes, safety and environmental programs, emergency response capabilities, and the benefits brought to the community by our being part of it. This binder was quite an undertaking for our small company. It took time to pull it all together, but was ready by the end of the day on June 29th. Our plan was to deliver it to the town halls, libraries, and local newspaper offices. (Yes, we had actually agreed to that! If it were public information, why not make the reporter's job easier instead of making him have to work so hard?)
<p>On June 30th, just as I was leaving my office to deliver the binders, my phone rang. "Hi!  This is Ruth from the newspaper. I know you guys have to report by tomorrow on all of your emissions. I was wondering if you could give me a 'heads up' on this?" I replied immediately. "I'm glad you called, Ruth. I have in my hand your copy of the binder we have put together that explains what this TRI data is all about and provides our data. Will you be in your office for the next half-hour?  I can be right over." You could have heard a pin drop. She obviously was not expecting that answer. She was sure she'd have to dig for the information. I thought I could hear the hissing sound of the wind coming out of her investigative sails. "Sure," she said, "come on over."
<p>Of course our whole management team held our collective breath until the newspaper hit our front stoops the next day. What a loud sigh of relief could be heard as we read the headline, "Company Makes Emissions Data Available to the Public."  The whole story was about the fact that we were being so open about it. The article didn't even mention the tons per year of our various chemicals going into the atmosphere. A subsequent story included a list of the "Dirty Dozen" of the county (those whose emission figures were among the twelve highest), but our name was not listed . Even had we appeared there, I am convinced that we would have gotten better treatment because we had gone "above and beyond" what was absolutely required.
<p><b>Another Example</b>
<p>In another instance, when the company received a bomb threat, I suggested to management that we be the ones to call the local media. At first they thought I had really lost my mind, but they were eventually persuaded that this was the right course of action.  By my contacting the local media, I could effectively plead for them to use discretion in the reporting so as not to stimulate a rash of copycat incidents.
<p>The media cooperated beautifully. Some didn't even mention it. Others wrote a brief, factual account that showed that the company responded appropriately to protect its employees and the community. Had they heard the call go out over the emergency scanner for the bomb-sniffing dogs to be sent to the plant, a reporter and photographer would have been immediately dispatched. This would have made a much bigger story, possibly encouraging others to try to cause the same level of excitement.
<p>While volunteering information to the media may be a strange idea to some, it is something you should at least consider. It can benefit your company image and your credibility with the media tremendously.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="cmba"></a>CRISIS MANAGER BUSINESS ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>

<p><b>Richard Levick Review Of Keeping The Wolves At Bay 2.0</b>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Richard Levick, litigation PR guru and co-author of "Stop the Presses: The Litigation PR Desk Reference", just wrote a review of the newly released version 2.0 of Keeping the Wolves at Bay: A Media Training Manual. I was blushing (although it's hard to see under my beard) by the time I got to the end of it, and am grateful to share it with you here.</i>
<p>"When Jonathan first asked me to write a review, he was very deliberate in his instructions -- tell the truth! If you don't like it, let them know. If you do like it, sing its praises as you see appropriate.
<p>"Those simple honest instructions tells us a lot about the man himself and the kind of work he does. His book <i>Keeping the Wolves at Bay 2.0</i> proves his considerable skill levels, his directness, and his abiding commitment to clients.
<p>"Here are six good reasons to use this manual.
<p>"First, the manual is smartly designed and lives up to its name. It is a cookbook for the sophisticated media spokesperson as well as the novice.
<p>"Second, it delivers. If you are going to face inquisitive journalists, you will learn what to expect and how to influence stories and reporters. The information is entertaining as well as helpful, and it does not over-promise.
<p>"Third, it is thorough. Most of the media training manuals, including those of some of the best training firms, are flawed with conspicuous gaps. Sometimes you get photocopies of old outlines with perfunctory advisory pointers, but not much detailed substance. This manual gives you plenty of pointers and plenty of substance.
<p>"Fourth, it is honest. You would be just as comfortable having the journalists themselves read it as your CEO clients. There is no effort to manipulate or insult anyone. It depicts the world of the media as it really is.
<p>"Fifth, it is abundant. There is so much good information in the manual that it will serve, not just your media spokespersons, but also the in-house and outside media consultants who seek to raise the media sophistication of all their clients. It is a textbook that delivers value to anyone who reads it.
<p>"And sixth, it is indeed valuable. I deal with the media everyday, yet I was still able to finish with a number of practical take-aways that will help me in my business.
<p>"I wish I had written Keeping the Wolves at Bay!"

<p><b>Teleseminar Cancelled -- Should I Reschedule?</b>
<p>The <i>Getting Serious About Crisis Preparedness: How to Motivate Your Management to Stop Playing Ostrich</i> teleseminar scheduled for March 24 was cancelled because as of about five days pre-event, there was only one reservation.  A couple of readers called a few days later asking how to register, but I need a higher number of participants just to break even against the cost.
<p>So...if you really meant/wanted to sign up for this teleseminar and couldn't for the previous date, send me email, &#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109&#46  This does not commit you, but if there is sufficient interest expressed for this topic, I will send notices about a rescheduled teleseminar DIRECTLY to each person who sent me email, versus simply listing it in the ezine and on my websites.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="cmu"></a>CRISIS MANAGER UNIVERSITY</h2>
<p><b>Making Amends</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>There has been a great deal of media coverage recently about public apologies and mea culpas offered for the harm caused by organizations or individuals.  There are many benefits to humbly admitting wrong and moving on.
<p>However, an apology is only half of the formula necessary to put negative publicity and reputation damage behind you -- and it's usually the least-important half.  The other critical element is making amends.
<p>Dictionaries define "amends" as "recompense for grievance or injury (American Heritage) or "to put right (Merriam-Webster)" or -- and this is my favorite, because it is plain English and speaks to the heart of the amends concept -- "to do something good to show that you are sorry about something you have done (Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary)."
<p>Hence, if what you have done -- intentionally or inadvertently -- has caused measurable damage, amends would be to repair, or offer some means of repairing, that damage, to include emotional or psychological damage, not just material and financial.
<p>Here's a simple example:
<p>At many restaurants, if you are served a well-done steak when you have ordered one medium-rare, you will get an apology from the server and they'll cook you another steak.  But how have you as a customer been harmed, in addition to not being able to eat yet? You may have suffered some degree of emotional stress over the delay, over not being able to eat at the same time as others at your table, and perhaps over being held up in your plans for after the meal.  None of these are addressed by a typical restaurant's "I'm sorry" and simple food replacement.
<p>At Claim Jumper, our favorite family restaurant, they consistently have a superb response to such mistakes, which inevitably happen from time to time at ANY eating establishment.  Immediately, the server apologizes, and then within a few minutes the manager appears, apologizes again for the mistake and inconvenience, assures us that the food replacement will be coming very soon, and tells us that they'll remove the item from our bill, even if it's the full price of a supper.  Both servers and managers crouch down to table level so that they can look you in the eye when talking -- a nice personal touch which communicates humility and sincerity. After the food arrives, the manager and/or server will wait by at the table until we're sure the replacement is satisfactory.  This is doing "something good to show that you are sorry about something you have done," this is effectively making amends.
<p>When extending that concept out to high-profile mistakes, one has to ask why more wasn't done by Martha Stewart to make amends not only to "the system" by serving time, but also to all of her local stakeholders who felt in some way betrayed or let down.
<p>An experiential observation: individuals with high "C-Factors" (the credibility rating I've written about previously) need amends less in order to survive crises.  It would take a great deal for any of us to trust (former Enron CEO) Ken Lay again. But Martha had a very high C-Factor going into her troubled times and, hence, seems to have come through it stronger than ever with "only" an apology and by making financial amends as required by the law.
<p>We need only to look to wrongdoing in personal relationships to realize that the tenth "I'm sorry" from a family member or friend who has wronged us in the same way over and over just doesn't cut it.  Until and unless that person is willing to make amends, we're not going to believe an apology.

<p><b>Valentine's Day Gift for All of Us</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>I was one of many, many Hallmark.com customers who was unable to access Hallmark e-cards sent to me on Valentine's day, as were some to whom I sent cards.  Their server was clearly overloaded, which was disappointing.  However, on February 16, Hallmark sent its customers this very well written letter of apology, one that epitomizes some of the best principles of crisis management, as I'll describe below the text.  Here, in case you missed it, was the letter:
<blockquote>
Dear Friend,
<p>We owe you an apology.  First, the important three words of this letter -- WE ARE SORRY.
<p>This Valentine's Day, our site was up and down all day. For many of you, that meant frustration and wasted time when you were simply trying to send or retrieve an e-card.
<p>We thought we were ready to handle a huge amount of traffic on Valentine's Day.  Obviously we thought wrong.  We were surprised by double the amount of traffic we expected.  And we cringe at the disappointment we caused to some of you.
<p>In short, we made promises to deliver that were not kept. And for those of you who experienced that disappointment, we are so sorry for any frustration we may have caused.
<p>Rest assured this experience will serve as a lesson for us. We are now challenging our team to reevaluate every step we took to prepare for Valentine's Day...because it wasn't enough.
<blockquote><p>With our deepest apologies,
<p>The Hallmark.com Team</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's grade the Hallmark Team against my <i>Five Tenets of Crisis Communications</i>, which state that crisis communications are ideally "Prompt, Compassionate, Honest, Informative and Interactive."
<p><b>Prompt</b> -- Ideally, Hallmark's letter should have gone out on February 15.  Two full days is a long time in our world of instant communication.  I'm sure they made a valiant effort to respond more quickly, but were under-prepared not only for server failure, but for the need to communicate in the event of a serious "business interruption."  Grade: B-.
<p><b>Compassionate</b> -- They clearly and convincingly expressed their compassion for the impact of the server overload.  Grade: A+.
<p><b>Honest</b> -- Almost to a fault.  A superb mea culpa.  Grade: A+.
<p><b>Informative</b> -- They provided us with the basics of what happened and what they're doing to ensure it doesn't happen again, without a lot of details unimportant to most of us.  Grade: A.
<p><b>Interactive</b> -- In most crisis situations, it's best to give your stakeholders a means of responding to your communication so that you know if it's effective, whether further communication is necessary, and also -- in this case -- to let customers know that they can vent or ask questions and that Hallmark recognizes their right to do so.  I think providing an email address or a link to a form by which customers could respond would have been practical and appropriate to the situation.  Grade: F.
<p>Now don't go trying to add up the point value of the grades to come up with an average, because in my opinion these factors are not equal and would have to be weighted, to include situation- specific weight, and that type of statistics-crunching crosses my eyes.  My subjective overall Grade: B+.
<p>Hallmark's C-Factor was high enough, going in, that the apology combined with assurances that they would ensure the same problem didn't recur was sufficient amends to satisfy darn near everyone. I seriously doubt they lost any business for their free or paid services.
<p align="CENTER"><img src="../art/bcmdivider1.gif" width="300" height="1" border="0"></p>

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b>  In response to my "The C-Factor" article about the importance of credibility in minimizing the impact of a crisis, a reader sent me this lovely combination of case history and compliment, so that we can all learn more and my ego can swell more.</i>
<p><b>Enhancing C-Factor</b><br><i>Email from a Crisis Manager Reader</i></p>
<p>We recently had a situation here in Winnipeg where one of the media outlets obtained some information from the Public Health Department about which restaurants had orders written against them.
<p>The media outlets, as they are prone to do, only let out enough information to create a story that would become foremost in the minds of the listener.
<p>One of the several restaurants, a small chain of Chinese eateries, immediately gave out a press release that there were only some small problems that were corrected right away to the satisfaction of the Public Health Department. The others chose not to comment.
<p>The only one that many of the people that I know will frequent out of that list is the one that gave an immediate press release. The others are on their black list.
<p>Up until now I had been paying attention to your ezine, but hadn't seen it working. Now it is a reality close to home and seems to mean a little more.
<p>Thanks for all the information that you have been sending, and I look forward to many more,

<p><b>Animals in Disasters -- Useful Link</b>
<p>I was sent a potentially useful link by the American Veterinary Medical Association:
<p><a href="http://www.avma.org/disaster" target="_blank">www.avma.org/disaster</a>
<p>They note that since 60% of American homes have at least one and, often, multiple pets, it's important to know how to address a pet's disaster-related needs.  Their educational materials "are provided to assist veterinarians, animal owners, and others interested in the well-being of animals to prepare for animal safety in the event of a disaster."
<p>Our four cats thanked me for making this announcement (and reading the AVMA material).

<p><b>CD-ROM: Crisis Management & The Law</b>
<br><b>How PR Pros & Lawyers Can Work Together Effectively</b>
<br><i>Featuring Jonathan Bernstein, Richard Levick and Ed Novak</i>
<p>On February 23, 2005, Jonathan Bernstein played talk show host and expert commentator in a one-hour teleseminar featuring internationally renowned litigation PR expert Richard Levick and one of the country's top white collar crime attorneys, Ed Novak. This CD-ROM is a "must have" to play for the executive staff of any organization, for practice group meetings at law firms, or for the entire staff of any PR agency. It captures the full teleseminar in which the threesome answered questions such as:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>If the attorney and PR person disagree, to whom should the CEO listen most closely?</li>
<p><li>When do PR considerations outweigh legal considerations, and vice versa?</li>
<p><li>What types of legal matters require close collaboration between legal and PR counsel?</li>
<p><li>What can a PR person do when dealing with an attorney who just doesn't "get it" with regard to crisis communications?</li>
<p><li>What can an attorney do when his client doesn't seem to understand the need for complementary PR?</li>
<p><li>What are some "right way/wrong way" examples that illustrate the principles of effective crisis management in legal matters?</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="jat"></a>JUST A THOUGHT</h2>
<p>Poor response to a crisis is typically a symptom of much broader organizational and ego problems.
<p><blockquote><i>Jonathan Bernstein</i></blockquote>
<p align="CENTER"><img height=1 width=455 src="../art/blackline.gif" vspace=0 hspace=0 border=0></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="cmu"></a>CRISIS MANAGER UNIVERSITY</h2>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> As more proof of Jung's theories regarding the existence of a "collective unconscious" into which we all tap, I was given the thought, above, a week before the Arthur Andersen announcement hit the press.</i>
<p><b>Arthur Andersen Self-destructed In The Court Of Public Opinion</b><br><i>by Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>Yesterday, May 31, headlines across the world trumpeted "Supreme Court Overturns Arthur Andersen Conviction".
<p>The remnants of the now-defunct, former industry leading  accounting and consulting firm, issued a press statement on PR  Newswire saying:
<blockquote>
<p>"We are very pleased with the Supreme Court's decision, which acknowledges the fundamental injustice that has been done to Arthur Andersen and its former personnel and retirees. We pursued an appeal of this case not because we believed Arthur Andersen could be restored to its previous position, but because we had an obligation to set the record straight and clear the good name of the 28,000 innocent people who lost their jobs at the time of the indictment and tens of thousands of Andersen alumni, as well as to help secure a fair resolution of the civil litigation facing the firm. This decision represents an important step in removing an unjustified cloud over the professionalism and integrity of the people of Arthur Andersen.
<p>"As we have stated, this decision has far-reaching implications for businesses and individuals across the country in the way routine business decisions are implemented."
</blockquote>
<p>The latter statement is true but regarding the former, as a British friend of mine is prone to say, "Bollocks!"
<p>At this time, do the majority of people really think that Arthur Andersen was innocent with regard to the Enron affair, or with regard to a number of similar-seeming situations in litigation prior to the Enron revelations?
<p>Does anything in the Supreme Court decision, which overturns the case on what most of us would call a "technicality," absolve Arthur Andersen where it really counts - where the battle for survival should have been focused - in the court of public opinion?
<p>I issued my own PR Newswire and Newsreleasewire.com release on May 31, which read, in part:
<blockquote>
<p>"'I believe that Arthur Andersen could have stayed in business, while legal matters proceeded, if its leadership had considered the court of public opinion to be as important as the courts of law,' said Jonathan Bernstein, president of national consultancy Bernstein Crisis Management, and editor of<i> Crisis Manager</i>, an international email newsletter.
<p>"'The Arthur Andersen decision issued by the Supreme Court today proves, yet again, that you can be legally right and still get destroyed by the court of public opinion," he said.
<p>"Bernstein recommends that companies faced with high-profile litigation ensure that legal and public relations strategy is closely integrated at the highest levels of the organization, with the final decisions on tactics and messaging coming from the CEO, not from either legal counsel or PR advisors.
<p>"'Too often, the default is 'do what our lawyers tell us to do,'" said Bernstein. 'That is fine as far as it goes, but attorneys are only trained to win in a court of law.  The best attorneys realize that the company has to survive in order for a legal win to mean anything, and the battle for survival often takes place outside the courtroom.'"
</blockquote>
<p>In response, and as a fitting conclusion to this article, a former  Arthur Andersen partner wrote the email below to me, one that verified all that I knew from very close contact with Arthur Andersen  personnel in the past.  The partner was kind enough to give me  permission to reprint this in a manner that preserved personal  anonymity, as virtually every former partner is now, at a minimum,  a "John Doe" or "Jane Doe" in ongoing litigation.
<blockquote>
<p>"I read your <i>Arthur Andersen Still Lost in the Court of  Public Opinion</i> on newsreleasewire.com today.  
<p>"I am a former Andersen partner, present during and after Enron destroyed the firm, and I agree 100% with your thoughts.  When Enron hit, the firm's leaders acted with typical arrogance.  They were sure the firm's reputation, blue-chip client base and history of integrity were proof that nothing adverse would happen. They saw no reason to address the public relations issues and in fact, held back on releasing a long-awaited, aggressive PR campaign (several hundred million) that the partners had previewed and that was scheduled for release at the end of 2001.  
<p>"It was embarrassing to see the complete absence of any leadership at all.  The firm deserved to be hung out to dry.  God knows, they would've advised their own clients to have 15 or so contingency plans in place to respond to such a crisis, but it could never happen to Andersen, so they didn't do it themselves.  
<p>"Never say never."
</blockquote>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b>How many consulting organizations do you know of that offer advice designed to protect and preserve their clients' welfare -- but then don't take a lot of their own advice?  It would be interesting to find out, for example, how many of the "top 100" law firms, or the surviving accounting firms, have actually engaged in the full spectrum of crisis preparedness work -- vulnerability assessment, planning, training and simulations. My guess?  Less than 10 percent.</i>

<p><b>Coming Attractions</b></p>
<p>I am in the pleasurable process of going through the new book by renowned lecturer and consultant Jim Lukaszewski, <i>Crisis Communication Plan Components and Models, Crisis Communication Management Readiness</i>, published jointly with the Public Relations Society of America.  A future issue of <i>Crisis Manager</i> will include a book review, excerpt and interview with Jim.
<p>Also in the works is an industry survey on crisis management-related topics I plan to conduct using new software made Available to me for that purpose -- which will, de facto, end up being a software review as well!

<p><b>Crisis Manager Article Gets The Most Hits In Polish Newsletter</b></p>
<p>I'm kinda tickled to announce that a previous <i>Crisis Manager</i> article about <i>The C-Factor</i>, <a href="http://www.bernsteincrisismanagement.com/nl/crisismgr050215.html#cmu" target="_blank">now archived here</a> was reprinted by permission in the Wiadomosci PRoto newsletter at the Polish website PRoto ("This is PR"). Publisher  Magda Klimkiewicz reported excitedly that the article received the most "clicks" of any piece they posted over a two-month period.
<p>Cudowny! Fantastyczny!

<p><b>What Good Is A Plan No One Knows About?</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar.  A mayor, city manager or other official responsible for implementing a disaster response plan (a) does have such a plan; (b) does implement the plan following a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or major flood; and (c) gets crucified by his/her constituency for following that plan - to the letter.
<p>The classic and all-too-common mistake on the part of the governmental official is that MOST of the people who will be impacted by the plan HAVE NO ADVANCE IDEA of how it will affect them.  They don't know they're likely to be denied access to their homes until a certain degree of safety can be assured, until basic infrastructure services can be provided, etc.  They don't know that city services will be assigned on a priority basis - and that your average homeowner isn't a priority in most cases.
<p>It's all about expectations.  I've heard it said that "expectations are often pre-meditated resentments."  Most who are not familiar with disaster response, either professionally or through the school of hard knocks, have default expectations far more optimistic than reality will grant them.  It's the task of the plan creators and disaster response team leaders to EDUCATE the populace BEFORE a disaster occurs.  Tell them what to expect. Remind them of it regularly.  Inform them what they can do to mitigate personal loss and damage.  And when disaster strikes, make sure you let them know, step by step, what's being done to roll out the plan and what that will mean to them.No one's going to be thrilled about having to endure the hardship, but they are far less likely to shoot the messenger and far more likely to be compliant with direction.
<p>This fatal flaw in most disaster planning often extends to other forms of crisis planning.  Organizations fail to consider everyone - internally or externally - who will be impacted by certain types of crises.  EVERY employee is a crisis manager for an organization, whether you want them to be or not.  Does every employee know what his or her job is when certain types of crises occur?  The job may simply be to refer inquiries to a member of the Crisis Communications Team, but the job might also mean getting physically involved with inspecting damaged buildings or calling employees who were home when the tornado hit.  It is not uncommon, unfortunately, for the senior-level members of the Crisis Communications Team or Emergency Response Team (the operational side of things) to be the only ones who know what everyone is expected to do - and then they have to try to find them and ask them to help, while in the midst of a crisis.
<p>Crisis simulations can reduce this risk, but even simulations - with the exception of huge undertakings - can't involve everyone who might be called on to assist in crisis response.  The best-possible solution, in my opinion, is orientation and refresher training for all employees, coordinated through Human Resources and mandated by organizational leadership.  Members of the response teams, including spokespersons, require more sophisticated levels of training and practice, but no employee should be left out of this process.  And don't just rely on loyalty as motivation for all employees to learn.  They also need to understand the very bottom line impact on them of poor crisis response - i.e., jobs, bonuses and benefits can all be impacted.

<p><b>Five Easy Ways To Prevent Crises</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Implement no major operational decision without asking a PR-savvy person to help you anticipate the response from all stakeholders, internal and external.</li>
<p><li>If you dare to...sit down and think, REALLY think, about what failure to prepare for crises could mean to all the people you work with, to those your organization serves, on a very personal basis.  Then let your conscience, not merely business instinct, guide your actions.</li>
<p><li>Ensure that at least two members of your leadership team are extremely Internet-savvy.</li>
<p><li>When criticized, say - with all sincerity - "You could be right." Then smile and break off the conversation.</li>
<p><li>When finding yourself caught up in a disagreement in which you're attempting to "fix" things, ask yourself, "How important is it?"</li>

<p><b>Five Easy Ways To Cause Crises</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Underestimate the power of a single angry consumer with a computer.</li>
<p><li>Have critical policies for which personnel receive little or no training and/or refresher training.</li>
<p><li>Use lawyers as a default response to detractors.</li>
<p><li>Fail to consider and plan for the impact of losing a key contractor or vendor.</li>
<p><li>Hire senior-level executives from other organizations without conducting thorough background checks.</li>

<p><b>Ask The Crisis Manager</b></p>
<p>When I'm hired to do a speaking engagement, I often ask the organizations to let me distribute - through them - a challenge to participants to send me descriptions of actual or potential crisis situations in advance of my appearance, so that I can use them to make teaching points.  It's fun for me as a writer and speaker, and my audiences seem to find it useful and entertaining.
<p>So I'm issuing that challenge to all of you, my subscribers. Don't just read - participate in your own education!  Be part of the solution!  Email me your situations, your inquiries, and I will answer them here.  I will assume that it's OK to cite you as the source of the query unless you say you'd prefer anonymity.  You can write simply by replying to the ezine or by writing directly to <a href="mailto:&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109</a>.

<p><b>Guest Authors?</b></p>
<p>I've always welcomed guest authors, as do my readers. I'm told that my authors often receive business inquiries as a result of appearing in this publication -- and it definitely raises your Google-ability (is that a word?) because of how highly my website is ranked. Original articles, or articles which have not likely been seen by my readership, are candidates for use in both the email and archived versions of this ezine.

<p><b>What Does That Slogan Mean?</b>
<p>By popular demand, I have re-opened an online store at which I sell clothing and mugs featuring the famous "Crisis Manager University" emblem and its infamous slogan, "Quoniam Stercus Accidit". That translates to "Because Stuff Happens." Except the real word isn't "stuff." There's only a 10% markup at the store to cover my costs -- it's a turnkey operation hosted by Cafe Press. I have found the items there to be a major hit with my clients and associates and great gift for any crisis manager. My purpose is to share my sense of humor with like (sick) minds as well as to prompt some folks to ask, "Who came up with this idea?"

<p>If you don't want to burden yourself with a lot of unwanted scrutiny, try being transparent.
<p><blockquote><i>Jonathan Bernstein</i></blockquote>
<p align="CENTER"><img height=1 width=455 src="../art/blackline.gif" vspace=0 hspace=0 border=0></p>

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> This issue features two marvelous submissions by "Crisis Manager" readers, starting with this one by a man who modestly told me nothing about his remarkable background when he sent the article in.  Be sure to check out both his website and complete bio at that URL.</i>
<p><b>Get Your Licks In On First Publication</b><br><i>By Donald R. Hamilton</i></p>
<p>Repeatedly during my years as a spokesperson at federal agencies in Washington and at U.S. embassies abroad, I would get a breathless media call going something like this:
<p><blockquote>"The Washington Project to Prevent Bad Things has called U.S. policy on (pick an issue) 'destructive, deceitful and misleading.'</blockquote>What is your reaction?"
<p>While you are trained to respond to the facts and not to speculate, you should avoid the temptation to give a cautious, studied response:
<p><blockquote>"We have not seen the report, so I really cannot comment."</blockquote>
<p>You know how that is going to read in tomorrow's papers and, if the subject is hot enough, on the evening and morning broadcasts:
<blockquote>
"The Project to Prevent Bad Things issued a stinging report on the Government's policy toward....  
<p>"A Government spokesman had no comment..." or
<p>"A Government spokesman said that they had not seen the report..." 
</blockquote>
<p>You know plenty of facts:  
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>The Project to Prevent Bad Things is constitutionally opposed to the administration's policy on this and every other issue.</li>
<p><li>They have an established record of selective citation of facts and always, always spin against you.</li>
<p><li>On many occasions, they have presented a distorted picture of actual happenings.</li>
<p><li>It is no accident that you have not seen the report nor that the Project gave the media the report on a day and at an hour where it will be hard for you to offer a substantive rebuttal.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are therefore safe in responding with a studied dismissal:
<p><blockquote>"U.S. policy on this matter is a practical and effective response to a complex issue. It is hard to see how any objective observer could find evidence to support charges like the ones attributed to the Project to Prevent."</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the Project to Prevent's history and general reputation, you might choose to become more aggressive.
<p><blockquote>"Those who follow this issue know that the Project to Prevent has a history of publishing tendentious and misleading accounts. We are confident that careful study of their most recent pamphlet will reveal a similar attempt to ensnare the unwary."</blockquote>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b>  While I appreciate Don introducing me to a new word -- tenditious -- I would respectfully submit that it's usually advisable to use language that can be understood by the majority of those with whom you're communicating.</i></p>
<p>The two-part lesson:

<ol type="1">
<p><li>Do not give known and vulnerable enemies a free shot just because you have not had the opportunity to read their latest screed.</li>
<p><li>Pay attention to the "known and vulnerable" part. Some critics deserve the back of your hand and you can take a shot. But others are more serious or have special standing that requires that you keep the gloves on regardless of the justice or injustice of their attacks:</li>

<ol type="a">
<p><li>The roof fell in on Ohio Congresswoman Jean Schmidt when she attacked the courage and patriotism of Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha.  Why?  Murtha is a decorated former combat Marine and has solid reputation as a National Defense Democrat. She might have gotten away with it had she been going after a non-veteran with a long history of voting against defense spending.</li>
<p><li>Survivors of violent events or the family members and loved ones of those who did not survive may make unfair criticisms, but you should remember what the public certainly would--they have been through a lot and the price they have paid gives them the right to complain all they want. They may discredit themselves, but you better not attack them.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><i>Donald R. Hamilton is the Executive Director of MIPT (<a href="http://www.mipt.org" target="_blank">www.mipt.org</a>), the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. Prior to his joining MIPT in 2000, Mr. Hamilton worked many years in the diplomatic service of the United States. In July 2003 Hamilton took a one-year leave of absence from MIPT to serve as a senior counselor to the Iraq Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator L. Paul Bremer.

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> When Andrea Obston wrote to me with cogent comments about my recent <a href="http://www.bernsteincrisismanagement.com/nl/crisismgr060901.html#cmu" target="_blank">Texas Roadhouse Makes Police Sick</a> story, and having researched her background a bit, I invited her to submit a story and darn if she didn't do that right away! I hope she returns with more submissions in the near future.</i>
<p><b>Dealing With Client Confidentiality And Reporters' Questions</b><br><i>By Andrea Obston</i></p>
<p>Even before the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) Privacy Rule was implemented, client confidentially was a sticky wicket for public relations professionals. Those of us who work with healthcare and social service clients have always understood the need for client confidentiality.  It goes with the turf.  Nevertheless, there's no getting used to the feeling of total helplessness in the face of a brewing crisis that involves a client whose story can't be told.  You know where this is going and you know your hands will be tied.  If your invoke client confidentiality, the agency you represent looks like they're taking The Fifth in front of a congressional committee.  On the other hand, if you acknowledge even the possibility that the particular client in question once sat in your waiting room, you're likely to get a visit from the agency's lawyer.  
<p>So what's a PR person to do?  The reality is that you simply cannot talk about specific clients to reporters.  We all know this and so do reporters.  But that doesn't stop them from trying. "Surely, you can understand that we have to maintain client confidentiality," I told one particularly aggressive reporter.  "No, I don't.  Why?" was his answer.  Well, there you have it.
<p>The problem is that just throwing out the issue of confidentiality raises eyebrows from both reporters and the public.  There's always the feeling that an organization is hiding something by invoking the client confidentiality response.
<p>We've done a lot of crisis management under these circumstances. Over the years, we've developed a stable of phrases that help us address these issues, preserve client confidentially and avoid closing down communication with reporters.  We suggest you adapt these to the situation, your personal style and the very-real concerns of your attorneys: 
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>"Commenting on specific clients would be a betrayal of their trust in this agency."</li>
<p><li>"We deal with our clients on a personal basis.  They share information with us in good faith and we cannot reveal it to others - either ethically or legally."</li>
<p><li>"We understand that the public has a right to know and that your job is to seek that information. But you must understand that, as caregivers, we must protect the confidentiality of the information we receive from our clients."</li>
<p><li>"Professional ethics require us to maintain client confidentiality even if it might be to our benefit to explain this situation.  We cannot share information any more than a lawyer or doctor can. These are the ethics our agency believes in."</li>
<p><li>"We cannot betray the confidentiality of our clients nor can we expose the most intimate details of their lives to the public. However, I understand that it is your job to report on this and we want to cooperate.  What I can share are some of the general facts about our client population, such as .....</li>
</ul>
<p>After you use one or more of these phrases, test to make sure the reporter still understands that you are not trying to hide or to end the conversation.  Do this by offering some other, useful information about the larger issues that the situation suggests, such as the need for adequate funding or the social stigma faced by those with certain health, socioeconomic or demographic issues.  
<p>By all means, do not let any of the above phrases be the last thing you say to a reporter.  If nothing else, ask if there is any other information you can get for him or her.  Be as responsive as possible at this point without apologizing.  It is a reporter's job to dig; it is yours to protect your clients and the people they serve.  Neither of you needs to apologize for doing your job well.

<p><b>Have Webcam And Videoconferencing, Will Consult</b>
<br><i>An Offer from Jonathan Bernstein</i>
<p>Would you like to bring me to your next staff or board meeting, virtually, to conduct some training on crisis preparedness, crisis response, or "just" to give a good solid orientation on the subject of crisis management?  There's a great value to "face time," but sometimes the cost and time required for travel make it impossible.  If you or your IT department can allow a webcam stream into your computer (and better yet if you can send one back), we don't need no stinkin' high-tech, we can do this lower tech.  I am constantly trying to bring more affordable services to clients who may not have the budget for other options, so this is an experiment. I have a webcam and am happy to bill by the hour for short-term consulting if this option is of interest.  There is also a videoconferencing facility very close to my office if you would like to use that instead. Call 626-825-3838 or write to <a href="mailto:&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109">&#106&#111&#110&#97&#116&#104&#97&#110&#64&#98&#101&#114&#110&#115&#116&#101&#105&#110&#99&#114&#105&#115&#105&#115&#109&#97&#110&#97&#103&#101&#109&#101&#110&#116&#46&#99&#111&#109</a>.

It can be purchased at <a href="http://www.thecrisismanager.com" target="_blank">www.thecrisismanager.com</a>, and its pages can be modified to make it YOUR "name brand" media training manual if you are an agency or organization that frequently conducts training.

<p><b>What Does That Slogan Mean?</b>
<p>By popular demand, I have re-opened an online store at which I sell clothing and mugs featuring the famous "Crisis Manager University" emblem and its infamous slogan, "Quoniam Stercus Accidit". That translates to "Because Stuff Happens." Except the real word isn't "stuff." There's only a 10% markup at the store to cover my costs -- it's a turnkey operation hosted by Cafe Press. I have found the items there to be a major hit with my clients and associates and great gift for any crisis manager. My purpose is to share my sense of humor with like (sick) minds as well as to prompt some folks to ask, "Who came up with this idea?" You can visit the store at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/crisismanager" target="_blank">www.cafepress.com/crisismanager</a>.

<p><b>Violence In The Workplace</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>I track crises in the news and have saved four different examples of workplace violence, usually ending in death(s), over the past month.  And that's just in the United States.  Yet so many organizations act as if it can't happen to them.
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Do you ever have employees who get angry to what appears to be near-violent levels?</li>
<p><li>Do you ever have employees get very emotionally distressed over being fired?</li>
<p><li>Do you ever have employees with strenuous domestic disputes?</li>
<p><li>Does the nature of your business attract potentially unstable people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hello!  Workplace violence could happen to you!  Those certainly aren't the only contributing factors, but they seem to be common threads in the stories I've read over the years.  
<p>What can you do about it?  If you're the boss, call a staff meeting ASAP.  If you're not the boss, take this article to your boss and suggest he/she call a staff meeting.  At the meeting, read the article.  Then have a brainstorming session, asking questions such as:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>What do we do to stay aware of and possible provide assistance to employees who may be under tremendous stress?</li>
<p><li>What would be the best way to protect personnel here if someone started shooting?</li>
<p><li>What would we say or do in the aftermath of violence?</li>
<p><li>Might it be helpful to have local experts on this topic come in and talk about how to prevent and respond to workplace violence?</li>
</ul>
<p>(P.S. The answer to the last one is YES)

<p><b>Oh Crikey - Virginia Tech Shooting Incident Happening Now</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p>Just as I finished writing the article above, I did one of my periodic CNN.com checks and found the story about the unfolding tragedy at Virginia Tech University where - if you are outside of the U.S. and haven't seen the story - 21 people are reported killed by a gunman who is still loose on campus.
<p>From the speed with which the university responded to lock down the campus, stay in touch with students by email, post statements on their website and make appropriate statements to the press, I am making an educated guess that Virginia Tech's leadership has already, wisely, engaged in crisis planning and training.
<p>In next 24-48 hours, school and police officials will be faced with:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Addressing the physical, emotional and other needs of victims and their loved ones</li>
<p><li>Addressing the needs of a shocked and mourning student body and faculty </li>
<p><li>Answering questions about how the incident occurred and if it could have been prevented or damage reduced</li>
<p><li>Conducting in-person meetings with as many stakeholders as possible</li>
<p><li>Using Internet-centered technology (if they're wise) to communicate with all their audiences in print and video formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>At best, it's a heart-wrenching and difficult task facing Virginia Tech's crisis management team.  I'm sure they, victims and everyone impacted can use our prayers right about now.

<p><i><b>Editor's Note</b>: Right way/wrong way examples are always particularly useful to me, and thus I very much appreciated receiving this succinct article by reader Karl Robe.  I usually present prospective or new clients with a list of potential crises much like the one Karl recommends.  I call it my "oh sh**" list because that's often the reaction it elicits!</i>
<p><b>When Crisis Hits, Think Like KPMG, Not Arthur Andersen</b><br><i>By Karl Robe</i></p>
<p>KPMGÕs near-fatal crisis involving the sale of allegedly illegal tax shelters provides a case study in crisis management. A front-page story in the Wall Street Journal took readers inside the decision-making process as executives determined the best strategy for averting criminal indictment. Indictment &#151; not conviction mind you &#151; led to the mass exodus of Arthur Andersen clients as well as partners, and, ultimately, the accounting firmÕs demise. The Journal story revealed how KPMG managed to keep its partners, clients, and, at the time of this entry, its doors open. (Client civil litigation looms.)  
<p>Unlike Andersen, KPMG executives &#151; including a former federal judge &#151; opted for a fall-on-the-sword strategy in front of the Justice Department. This strategy does have potential pitfalls, which also were described in the Journal story. 
<p>Most executives, I believe, think of the potential for a crisis as a low-probability, high-impact event. In fact, if executives take five minutes to list potential vulnerabilities that could sink their company, I believe the list would lead them to a different conclusion. The probability of crisis in any business is high. The probability of survival is low without being prepared and understanding how to deal with the different stakeholders during a crisis. A few points to consider &#151; with your attorneys and public relations counsel present &#151; if faced with a crisis:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Dump the bad news: tell it all at once. </li>
<p><li>Admit wrongdoing and apologize.</li>
<p><li>Fix the wrong.</li>
<p><li>Communicate plans to avoid it happening again.</li>
<p><li>Execute on those plans.</li>
<p><li>Provide stakeholders with progress reports along the way. </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Editor's Note:</b> My colleague and frequent ezine contributor Gerald Baron succinctly and thoughtfully discusses the short- and longer-term impact of the Virginia Tech tragedy.</i>
<p><b>How the World Changed After Virginia Tech</b><br><i>By Gerald Baron</i></p>
<p>It is an axiom of crisis management that an organization going through a major crisis is changed forever. But there are some crises that change not just the organization, but also the surrounding environment. I believe that will prove to be the case with the horrific tragedy at Virginia Tech.
<p>Here are my thoughts about how this event will forever alter the landscape of crisis management:
<p>1) The media fault finding will worsen before it improves.
<blockquote>Once again the mainstream media demonstrated that their standard reporting of such situations demands that someone must be blamed--someone must wear the black hat. And the person who carried out the deed, now among the dead, doesnÕt qualify. So the blame was immediately placed on the administration for failing to take immediate action and to notify the campus community. Never mind that there have been few if any precedents of a domestic violence incident ramping up to a wanton murderous rampage. The mainstream media is under incredible financial and audience pressure--witness the further staff reductions at the LA Times. Their reaction is to work all the harder to build and maintain audiences. The implication for crisis managers is that they must be fully prepared to operate with a black hat squarely and unquestioningly placed on their heads. The question about NBCÕs airing of the macabre tape from the killer needs to be put in the context of their realization that it would show up on the Internet for sure. Knowing that the viewing was inevitable, should they pass on the opportunity to be the focal point? That was the real question they faced. </blockquote>
<p>2) Every action seems to demand an over-reaction.
<blockquote>In the days following the tragedy dozens if not scores of schools went into lock down. Notifications were streaming right and left. No one wanted to be accused of lack of response, and certainly there were incidents of copycat behavior. Nevertheless, those responsible for emergency response and communication need to understand how an event like this suddenly puts everyone on edge. University leaders across the nation were having to answer the question to local media as to how they would have responded and how they would have communicated to students and the campus community. Be prepared to answer those questions, regardless of the industry you are in. This event was focused on the universities, but the next one may be focused on your segment and you need to be prepared to answer how you are meeting the suddenly elevated standards.</blockquote>
<p>3) SMS and social media emerge as critical emergency notification requirements.
<blockquote>No self-respecting emergency management and communication plan can now fail to address text messaging and social media. This event made the role of social media such as Facebook as a new form of communication with young people a common topic of conversation. And the world now seems much more aware that you need to use cell phones with text messages if you really want to reach people moving about a campus. This is a tremendous change in thinking for many in crisis management. But reporters and stakeholders will not go back to a day when this was new and unheard of. In one or two days, these modes have entered the world of the commonplace, the expected and demanded.</blockquote>
<p>4) What becomes possible becomes expected, then demanded.
<blockquote>Imagine what you would say if someone told you they couldnÕt get an urgent package to you in less than a week? Federal Express made overnight--even same day--shipment possible. And what becomes possible ultimately becomes demanded. So it is with the new forms of instant communication. I predict a critical leap will be made from this event: if students have a right to expect to be notified of life or health threatening events virtually instantaneously, why should I not expect that as an employee? Or as a citizen of a town or city? If universities can communicate instantaneously via text message and new forms of communication such as Facebook or MySpace, why cannot employers, city leaders, and fire chiefs? Although this new expectation will take some time, in retrospect, I believe that we will look back at Virginia Tech as the incident that resulted in the ubiquitous use of instant notification services. And the implications for anyone in crisis management are very significant.</blockquote>
<p>Hurricane Katrina made everyone evaluate their emergency plans with the new wrinkle that you can no longer assume that your Emergency Operation Center and all your infrastructure will be there when you need it. Virginia Tech will have a similar effect--now instant notification will be a critical part of all plans. So, how will you address the now heightened expectations?

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> When media relations guru Jerry Brown once again tackled the subject of crisis communications, I was quick to request permission to bring his thoughts back to "Crisis Manager" readers.</i>
<p><b>Get a Good Crisis Communications Plan or Expect Disaster</b><br><i>By Jerry Brown, APR</i></p>
<p>If you donÕt have a good crisis communications plan, you have a disaster waiting to happen.
<p>The events of the past few weeks -- including Virginia Tech -- certainly are a good reminder of that.  I wonÕt bore you with my take on the various events that weÕve all seen unfold.
<p>Instead, an observation from Tom Hoog, former CEO of Hill & Knowlton and father of Michael Hoog of Corporate Advocates where I hang my hat much of the time.
<p>According to Tom, there are two kinds of companies:  Those that have had a crisis and those that will have a crisis.
<p>If youÕre not ready for your crisis before it happens, youÕll probably have a disaster on your hands -- including a media disaster. 
<p>The good news is that writing an effective crisis communications plan is easier than you may think.
<p>You have three basic objectives in any crisis:
<ol type="1">
<p><li>Fix the problem.  Fixing the problem is fundamental; but itÕs not enough.</li>
<p><li>Say what youÕre doing to fix it.  Unless youÕre telling the rest of us what youÕre doing, many of us will assume youÕre not doing anything -- or at least that youÕre not doing enough or donÕt care enough.  Failing to say what youÕre doing to fix the problem may do you more harm than the problem that caused the crisis.</li>
<p><li>Tell us what youÕre doing to keep it from happening again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your crisis communications plan is a blueprint for doing Steps 2 and 3.
<p>Your plan is about the logistics of the communications, not the content.  The content will be driven by what happens during the crisis.
<p>Less is more when it comes to writing your crisis communications plan.
<p>The temptation is to write an encyclopedia covering every potential situation.  It wonÕt get used.
<p>What you want is a simple blueprint for:
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Collecting accurate information as quickly as possible.</li>
<p><li>Streamlining approvals so you have green light to use it.</li>
<p><li>Communicating information quickly and effectively to the right audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>ThatÕs my two centsÕ worth.  WhatÕs yours?

<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> I wrote my first version of this article in, I believe, 1990, when I was heading up the Crisis Communications Group for international PR agency Ruder Finn, Inc.  Since then, I have periodically updated it to reflect both what I have experienced and changes in the way we engage in crisis communications.  For a time, it even became the "11 Steps." Over the years, I have also had more requests for reprints of this piece than anything else I've written and it's been widely translated, which thrills me.  Now, I'm pleased to be able to present you with the mid-2007 version, back to 10 Steps again!</i>
<p><b>The 10 Steps of Crisis Communications</b><br><i>By Jonathan Bernstein</i></p>
<p><blockquote><i><b>Crisis:</b> Any situation that is threatening or could threaten to harm people or property, seriously interrupt business, damage reputation or negatively impact share value.</i></blockquote>
<p>Every organization is vulnerable to crises. The days of playing ostrich are gone. You can play, but your stakeholders will not be understanding or forgiving because they've watched what happened with Bridgestone-Firestone, Bill Clinton, Arthur Andersen, Enron, Worldcom, 9-11, The Asian Tsunami Disaster, Hurricane Katrina and Virginia Tech. 
<p>If you don't prepare, you WILL take more damage. And when I look at existing "crisis management" plans while conducting a "crisis document audit," what I often find is a failure to address the many communications issues related to crisis/disaster response. Organizations do not understand that, without adequate communications: 
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Operational response will break down.</li>
<p><li>Stakeholders (internal and external) will not know what is happening and quickly be confused, angry, and negatively reactive.</li>
<p><li>The organization will be perceived as inept, at best, and criminally negligent, at worst. </li>
</ul>
<p>The basic steps of effective crisis communications are not difficult, but they require advance work in order to minimize damage. The slower the response, the more damage is incurred. So if you're serious about crisis preparedness and response, read and implement these 10 steps of crisis communications, the first seven of which can and should be undertaken before any crisis occurs. 
<p><b>The 10 Steps of Crisis Communications</b>
<p><b>1.	Identify Your Crisis Communications Team </b>
<p>A small team of senior executives should be identified to serve as your organization's Crisis Communications Team. Ideally, the team will be led by the organization's CEO, with the firm's top public relations executive and legal counsel as his or her chief advisers. If your in-house PR executive does not have sufficient crisis communications expertise, he or she may choose to retain an agency or independent consultant with that specialty. Other team members should be the heads of major organization divisions, to include finance, personnel and operations. 
<p>Let me say a word about legal counsel. Sometimes, during a crisis, a natural conflict arises between the recommendations of the organization's legal counsel on the one hand, and those of the public relations counsel on the other. While it may be legally prudent not to say anything, this kind of reaction can land the organization in public relations "hot water" that is potentially, as damaging, or even more damaging, than any financial or legal ramification. Fortunately, more and more legal advisors are becoming aware of this fact and are working in close cooperation with public relations counsel. The importance of this understanding cannot be underestimated. Arthur Anderson lost its case and went out of business due to the judgment rendered by the court of public opinion, not the judgment of a court of law. 
<p><b>2.	Identify Spokespersons </b>
<p>Within each team, there should be individuals who are the only ones authorized to speak for the organization in times of crisis. The CEO should be one of those spokespersons, but not necessarily the primary spokesperson. The fact is that some chief executives are brilliant business people but not very effective in-person communicators. The decision about who should speak is made after a crisis breaks &#151; but the pool of potential spokespersons should be identified and trained in advance. 
<p>Not only are spokespersons needed for media communications, but for all types and forms of communications, internal and external, including on-camera, at a public meeting, at employee meetings, etc. You really don't want to be making decisions about so many different types of spokespersons while "under fire." 
<p><b>3.	Spokesperson Training </b>
<p>Two typical quotes from well-intentioned organization executives summarize the reason why your spokespersons should receive professional training in how to speak to the media: 
<blockquote>
"I talked to that nice reporter for over an hour and he didn't use the most important news about my organization."
<p>"I've done a lot of public speaking. I won't have any trouble at that public hearing." 
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the first example, there are a good number of people interviewed by CBS' "60 Minutes" or ABC's "20/20" who thought they knew how to talk to the press. In the second case, most executives who have attended a hostile public hearing have gone home wishing they had been wearing a pair of Depends.
<p>All stakeholders &#151; internal and external &#151; are just as capable of misunderstanding or misinterpreting information about your organization as the media, and it's your responsibility to minimize the chance of that happening.
<p>Spokesperson training teaches you to be prepared, to be ready to respond in a way that optimizes the response of all stakeholders. 
<p><b>4.	Establish Notification Systems </b>
<p>Remember when the only way to reach someone quickly was by a single phone or fax number, assuming they were there to receive either?
<p>Today, we have to have &#151; immediately at hand &#151; the means to reach our internal and external stakeholders using multiple modalities.  Many of us have several phone numbers, more than one email address, and can receive SMS (text) messages or faxes.  Instant Messenger programs, either public or proprietary, are also very popular for business and personal use.  We can even send audio and video messages via email.  Depending on how "techie" we choose to be, all of this type of communication &#151; and more &#151; may be received on or sent by a single device!
<p>It is absolutely essential, pre-crisis, to establish notification systems that will allow you to rapidly reach your stakeholders using multiple modalities.  The Virginia Tech catastrophe, where email was the sole means of alerting students initially, proves that using any single modality can make a crisis worse.  Some of us may be on email constantly, others not so.  Some of us receive our cellphone calls or messages quickly, some not.  If you use more than one modality to reach your stakeholders, the chances are much greater that the message will go through.
<p>For a long time, those of us in crisis management relied on the old-fashioned "phone tree" and teams of callers to track people down.  But today there is technology &#151; offered by multiple vendors and also available for purchase &#151; that can be set up to automatically start contacting all stakeholders in your pre-established database and keep trying to reach them until they confirm (e.g., by pressing a certain number on a phone keypad) that the message has been received.  Technology that you can trigger with a single call or email.  
<p><b>5.	Identify and Know Your Stakeholders</b>
<p>Who are the internal and external stakeholders that matter to your organization? I consider employees to be your most important audience, <i>because every employee is a PR representative and crisis manager for your organization whether you want them to be or not!</i>  But, ultimately, all stakeholders will be talking about you to others not on your contact list, so it's up to you to ensure that they receive the messages you would like them to repeat elsewhere.
<p><b>6.	Anticipate Crises </b>
<p>If you're being proactive and preparing for crises, gather your Crisis Communications Team for long brainstorming sessions on all the potential crises which can occur at your organization. 
<p>There are at least two immediate benefits to this exercise: 
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>You may realize that some of the situations are preventable by simply modifying existing methods of operation. </li>
<p><li>You can begin to think about possible responses, about best case/worst case scenarios, etc. Better now than when under the pressure of an actual crisis. </li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, of course, you know that a crisis will occur because you're planning to create it &#151; e.g., to lay off employees, or to make a major acquisition. Then, you can proceed with steps 8-10 below, even before the crisis occurs. 
<p>There is a more formal method of gathering this information that I call a "vulnerability audit," about which <a href="http://www.bernsteincrisismanagement.com/services.html">information is available here</a>. 
<p><b>7.	Develop Holding Statements</b> 
<p>While full message development must await the outbreak of an actual crisis, "holding statements" &#151; messages designed for use immediately after a crisis breaks &#151; can be developed in advance to be used for a wide variety of scenarios to which the organization is perceived to be vulnerable, based on the assessment you conducted in Step 6 of this process. An example of holding statements by a hotel chain with properties hit by a natural disaster &#151; before the organization headquarters has any hard factual information &#151; might be: 
<blockquote>
"We have implemented our crisis response plan, which places the highest priority on the health and safety of our guests and staff." 
<p>"Our hearts and minds are with those who are in harm's way, and we hope that they are well." 
<p>"We will be supplying additional information when it is available and posting it on our website." 
</blockquote>
<p>The organization's Crisis Communications Team should regularly review holding statements to determine if they require revision and/or whether statements for other scenarios should be developed. 
<p><b>8.	Assess the Crisis Situation</b> 
<p>Reacting without adequate information is a classic "shoot first and ask questions afterwards" situation in which you could be the primary victim. But if you've done all of the above first, it's a "simple" matter of having the Crisis Communications Team on the receiving end of information coming in from your communications "tree," ensuring that the right type of information is being provided so that you can proceed with determining the appropriate response. 
<p>Assessing the crisis situation is, therefore, the first crisis communications step you can't take in advance. But if you haven't prepared in advance, your reaction will be delayed by the time it takes your in-house staff or quickly-hired consultants to run through steps 1 to 7. Furthermore, a hastily created crisis communications strategy and team are never as efficient as those planned and rehearsed in advance. 
<p><b>9.	Identify Key Messages</b> 
<p>With holding statements available as a starting point, the Crisis Communications Team must continue developing the crisis-specific messages required for any given situation. The team already knows, categorically, what type of information its stakeholders are looking for. What should those stakeholders know about <i>this</i> crisis? Keep it simple &#151; have no more than three main messages for all stakeholders and, as necessary, some audience-specific messages for individual groups of stakeholders. 
<p><b>10.	Riding Out the Storm</b> 
<p>No matter what the nature of a crisis...no matter whether it's good news or bad...no matter how carefully you've prepared and responded...some of your stakeholders are not going to react the way you want them to. This can be immensely frustrating. What do you do? 
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>Take a deep breath. </li>
<p><li>Take an objective look at the reaction(s) in question. Is it your fault, or their unique interpretation? </li>
<p><li>Decide if another communication to those stakeholders is likely to change their impression for the better. </li>
<p><li>Decide if another communication to those stakeholders could make the situation worse. </li>
<p><li>If, after considering these factors, you think it's still worth more communication, then take your best shot! </li>
</ul>
<p><b>"It Can't Happen To Me" </b>
<p>When a healthy organization's CEO or CFO looks at the cost of preparing a crisis communications plan, either a heavy investment of in-house time or retention of an outside professional for a substantial fee, it is tempting for them to fantasize "it can't happen to me" or "if it happens to me, we can handle it relatively easily." 
<p>Hopefully, that type of ostrich-playing is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Yet I know that thousands of organizations hit by Hurricane Katrina will have, when all is said and done, suffered far more damage than would have occurred with a fully developed crisis communications plan in place. This has also been painfully true for scores of clients I have served over the past 25 years. Even the best crisis management professional is playing catch up &#151; with more damage occurring all the time &#151; when the organization has no crisis communications infrastructure already in place. 
<p><b>The Last Word &#151; For Now </b>
<p>I would like to believe that organizations worldwide are finally "getting it" about crisis preparedness, whether we're talking about crisis communications, disaster response or business continuity. Certainly client demand for advance preparation has increased dramatically in the past half-decade, at least for my consultancy. But I fear that there is, in fact, little change in what I have said in the past, that 95 percent of American organizations remain either completely unprepared or significantly under-prepared for crises. And my colleagues overseas report little better, and sometimes worse statistics. 
<p>Choose to be part of the prepared minority. Your stakeholders will appreciate it!

<p><b>National Campus Security Summit May 30</b></p>
<p>The University of Central Oklahoma and the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism are presenting the 2007 National Campus Security Summit on May 30, 2007.  This Summit is designed for senior campus administrators and law enforcement personnel as a venue for information and discussion in planning, preparation, and response to emergencies which could adversely affect students, faculty, staff, and the community near the campus.
<p>Universities and law enforcement agencies are invited to send up to five participants to the event.

However, vendors and other organizations with emergency products and services are invited to participate in the Virtual Trade Show.  See <a href="http://campussecuritysummit.ucok.edu/virtual_trade_show.htm" target="_blank">http://campussecuritysummit.ucok.edu/virtual_trade_show.htm</a> for details."

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #C80000"><a name="cmu"></a>CRISIS MANAGER UNIVERSITY</h2>
<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> I received this disguised case history from my long-time friend and associate Bob Aronson, one of the country's finest crisis management consultants and media trainers, now partially retired as he recovers from a heart transplant.  It describes a situation quite similar to one in which I've found myself at times.  As Bob told me in his introductory email, "It describes an angle that should always be considered when crisis managers are advising CEO's amidst a plentitude of other advisors whether internal, external or both. Bottom line is that what appears to be poor decision making on the part of the CEO may be because some of us crisis counselors may not strongly enough defend our positions in a manner that clearly shows concern for the client, not in stretching out a process that is costly and not productive." </i>

<p><b>Crisis Counselors - Stand Your Ground</b>
<br><i>By Bob Aronson</i></p>

<p>This is a situation I was involved in a few years back in which a brilliant CEO continually rejected my crisis management advice in favor of a strategy that got the negative result I predicted while costing a whole lot more in money, time, stress and brand than was necessary.  Confidentiality does not allow me to provide the name of the client or even accurately allude to the situation, but I thought it worthy of consideration by crisis managers who meet with this kind of situation.

<p>Here is some of the story.  I was involved in a crisis in which a medium was investigating my client for how they were spending money (as accurate as I dare get).  The medium insisted on doing an interview and I agreed we should do one given that we could first interview them, limit the length of the interview (30  minutes), determine the place and have adequate time to prepare.  I advised my client that while I was convinced the medium had already determined the outcome of the story; I thought we should try to get a message across and avoid the "no comment" trap.  I also advised that while I was unlikely to agree to another  interview, we should give heavy emphasis to a strategic communications plan directed at employees, clients, the Board of Directors (BOD) and other key audiences.  I wanted to ensure that these people were aware of what the CEO and executive leadership were doing and to provide facts that were unlikely to appear in the medium.   

<p>The meeting with two reporters took place on our terms and it was immediately clear that they were only interested in proving their point, despite the fact that our CEO performed brilliantly.  Within hours of the interview, we received emails from them with more questions of a highly biased nature and a request for a second, longer meeting.  My reaction to this request was consistent with my earlier advice, "We'll provide a statement based on our messages, but will not agree to another interview."  After a few discussions with my client, it became clear that he was not in agreement with me.  The next thing I knew, another crisis consultant was retained to, "Help me manage the situation."  This "expert" advised full cooperation with the medium.  Again, I noted that to do so focuses too much on the medium and would, "Not change the story, cost a ton of money in consultant fees and unnecessarily place the organizational and CEO's brand at great risk."  My advice was rejected again. 

<p>Shortly the medium released their first in a series of stories.  It was loaded with damaging, unsubstantiated, untrue allegations.  Not long after that story they made a request for still another interview, maybe more. I, becoming more and more frustrated with our reaction, strongly (not strongly enough) suggested that we stick with my original advice.  My "helping" crisis consultant disagreed, the CEO took their advice and another interview was scheduled.  It, too, despite our best efforts, preparation and brilliant performance by the CEO, was more damaging than the first one.  The medium simply refused to recognize any facts we provided.  

<p>To make a long story short, after several months, thousands of consultant billable hours and continuing damage to the client's name the final story was released and it was as bad, if not worse, than I originally predicted.  

<p>Now the question is, "If the CEO was so brilliant, why did he continue to side with the consultant that was operating in a (my opinion) self-serving, billable hours manner?  The answer?  Board of Directors pressure.  The CEO knew my advice was appropriate and the advice of the other consultant would not help.  He must have thought, though, that in light of a series of "bad" stories the BOD would continue to ask, "Why aren't you doing more?"  He felt, I am sure, that while my suggestion had the BOD as a top audience, that we could not adequately satisfy their needs and that the bad stories would make him look impotent and indecisive.  He therefore chose to attempt to show leadership even if it was the wrong approach.  I assume his thought process was to have the BOD think, "He's done everything humanly possible, hired the best consultants and was well prepared.  The media, though, is so biased the efforts failed."  It is likely the CEO was depending on a general distrust of the media to help his cause. While the BOD was not happy with the outcome, they at least would feel the CEO had cooperated in every manner and made every effort to save the organization.  I should point out, too, that my crisis-managing "helper" never once mentioned nor tried to address the BOD concerns the CEO might have.  Their entire emphasis was on trying to manipulate the medium.

<p>I am confident that my strategy would have accomplished every goal and would have been less stressful, less costly and the entire process would have been much shorter.  Unfortunately, there are consultants whose advice is more based on billable hours than on integrity and the best interest of the client.  What would I do differently?  I would be more aggressive from the start and would have more vigorously defended my position.  Can I guarantee that emotion and self preservation would not prevail anyway?  No.  But I know that as crisis counselors we owe it to the client to be as assertive as possible.

<p><b>Source of Australian Spoof Video</b>
<p>A number of readers were delighted by the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3bdjgo" target="_blank">spoof video interview</a> to which I linked in the past issue.  Some wanted to know if it was based on a real incident and the answer is "yes."  Thanks to Aussie crisis management pro Jim Truscott for providing the details: "The video is a spoof by two well known comedians in Australia who feature at the end of evening current affairs on TV.  They are however talking about a real and very recent incident.  An empty coal ship ran aground on a beach in a major storm just beside and outside the river mouth of the Hunter River in Newcastle which is a major town just north of Sydney and a major coal export port to Asia.  It took days to finally drag it off with a great risk of oil spill."

<p><b>Virtual Picketers</b>

<p><b>Cargill Demonstrates Lack of Compassion</b>
<p>Cargill Meat Solutions issued a massive 844,812-lb voluntary recall of frozen ground beef patties for suspected E. Coli contamination on October 6 into a consumer market already hammered by news of an even larger recall by Topps, one which destroyed the latter company.

<p>As is my wont, I went to Cargill's website to read what they had to say about the recall, unfiltered by media, and found <a href="http://http://tinyurl.com/392du8" target="_blank">this release</a>.  It prompted me to send an email to the designated press contact, Mark Klein, on October 7:

<blockquote>Mark, I'm sure you have your hands full right now, but I wanted to point out one of the biggest mistakes companies make during times of crisis, a mistake really important to avoid when there's a threat to health -- failing to express compassion for the impact on your stakeholders.  It's not necessary to admit fault in order to say things like "We deeply regret any concern this situation causes to consumers and will do everything we can to ensure that this product is quickly and safely recalled." 
 
<p>Might even put your CEO on video saying things like that -- and put it on your website.  

<p>Just a thought!

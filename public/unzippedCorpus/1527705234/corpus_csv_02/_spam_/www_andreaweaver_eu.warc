		<h2>Readers' Comments</h2>
			<p align="justify">'Dear Andrea, <br>
			It was happened accidently that the "My Angel?!" book felt into my hands and I read it several times and it trilled me. I believe that if the "My Angel?!" goes through to the half of the people there lives would be nicer.'</p>
			<p align="justify"><em>'I am writing behalf of my friend. He read the "The Eleventh Commandment" and he liked so much the way how you write and your style and he appreciated your humor. He said that he could not put the book down and he read it to two days.'</em></p>
			<p align="justify">'I would like to thank you this amazing book, "My Angel?!". After I got it I put it on the shelf and I haven't read it for half a year but when I started to read it I finished within few days. I believe that was the perfect time to me when I was ready to learn most from it. Thank you one more time! Today I ended the book but I am going to start read it again recently. I wish you could write a lot of similar book in the future.'</p>
			<p align="justify"><em>'Firstly, I would like to thank that you are existing, secondly I would like to thank you the book, "My Angel?!". I learned a lot from it, I had known lot of things before I read it but only now I could put the pictures together totally in my-self. Thank you one more time.'</em></p>
			<p align="justify">'I didn't have to read your book for long to feel that special feeling that I constantly felt during I read the book, I felt I arrived home. I could not express my feeling clearly but you now the best, there are feelings whereat there are not words...'</p>

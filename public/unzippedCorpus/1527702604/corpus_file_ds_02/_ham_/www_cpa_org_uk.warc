Established in 1947 by the Nuffield Foundation the charity Centre for Policy on Ageing has been working to promote the interests of older people through research, policy analysis, its unique library and information services and the dissemination of information.  We have always drawn directly on the experiences of older people themselves to enhance the sharing of knowledge and good practice in all sectors. It is more important than ever to have an independent and trusted source of knowledge that can help inform those influencing the design and planning of services to improve later life for all.<br><br>
Due to a breakdown in lease negotiation the charity has been given a month to relocate itself and we urgently seek your help in the form of practical assistance, <a href="http://www.cpa.org.uk/cpa/donate.html" target="_blank">financial donations</a> or much needed advice to ensure we not only survive this massive dislocation but that we thrive and develop our resources to meet the challenges of our growing ageing population.<br><br>

<br>Gerontology has long been seen as an area for multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research essential to the understanding of human ageing with specific institutional examples of collaborative working since the 1980s.
    The more complex issue of inter-disciplinary work, where approaches are integrated rather than viewed separately, has raised a number of obstacles. 
<br>This seminar  heard from those who have been part of this history, and brought together social gerontologists and experts from the arts, humanities and design/ergonomics to address a variety of questions.
<br>Speakers included: Professor Catherine Hennessy (Plymouth University); Professor Miriam Bernard (Keele University) and Professor Sheila Peace (The Open University)

CPA also welcomes the raising of the threshold for support to £123,000 so that more older people on low income can receive financial support. It is hoped that over time, and as the economic  situation allows, the cap of &pound;75,000 at 2017 prices can be reduced, in real terms, to levels closer to those proposed by Dilnot.

The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has launched a new website: <b>"A Better Life: old age, new thoughts"</b>  <a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/betterlife" target="_blank">http://www.jrf.org.uk/betterlife</a> . This site gives older people's voices and perspectives a platform, and through this JRF hope to highlight older people's experiences, resilience and ability to flourish across a century of huge change.

The current funding system for adult social care in England is unfair, unduly complex and has been neglected to the point of near collapse.<br>
The Commission proposes a 'strong foundation on which to build reform of the social care system' and one where no-one will be expected to lose all their savings and assets in order to fund often unexpected and 'catastrophic' costs of care and support.<br>
CPA urges the Government to act quickly and commit to the Commission's achievable timetable of a White Paper by next Spring. <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Press release</a>. -->

 Research shows that older people want and value low-level support - 'that bit of help' But the benefits of investing in this are realised over many years, making it harder to prove impact and protect funding in the face of severe pressure on spending.

By 2051, in England and Wales,  there will be 3.8 million black and minority ethnic older people aged 65 and over and 2.8 million aged 70 and over.  The ageing of individual ethnic minority communities will have an impact not only on the need for services but also on the communities themselves. For example, it is estimated that between 2001 and 2051 there will be a 45-fold increase in the number of people with dementia in the Black African ethnic minority community.<br><br>The full report can be found at <a href="http://www.cpa.org.uk/reportsandreviews">www.cpa.org.uk/reportsandreviews</a>.</td></tr>
